<div class="intro"><p>Audacity is often included with USB turntables, USB cassette decks or USB audio interfaces, and is suitable for recording from any USB audio device using the instructions on this page.</p><p>USB audio devices connect to the computer's USB port and are used to transfer records, or tapes, to digital audio files (from which <a href="burning_music_files_to_a_cd.html" title="Burning music files to a CD">audio CDs</a> can be burnt). This is very useful if your computer does not have the necessary line-in port for digitizing LPs or cassettes with a conventional turntable or tape deck. USB turntables often include a line input to which standard tape decks or similar sources can be connected for transfer to the computer.</p></div>
<div class="note">Much of the information on this page, and the pages linked to below, also apply to recording with USB tape cassette decks and audio devices connected with external USB audio interfaces.
<p>Please see the Audacity Wiki page on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/USB_turntables">USB Turntables</a> for a fuller discussion of the operation of these devices.
</p><p>Some users with extensive experience of digitizing LPs and tapes believe that connecting a good quality conventional turntable or tape deck to an external USB audio interface is an ideal solution. USB audio interfaces usually do not suffer from the transmission problems of USB turntables or tape decks, and are also free from the random clicky noise that can afflict sound devices built into computer motherboards. Moreover their analog-to-digital converter (ADC) may be superior to that provided with a USB turntable

<div id="software"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ensure_the_Audacity_software_is_up_to_date">Ensure the Audacity software is up to date</span></h2>
<p>Make sure you have the current version of Audacity as the software provided on the device manufacturer's CD can be out-of-date. Note that neither the version number of the CD nor that of any guides produced by the manufacturers necessarily relates to the Audacity version number. To check your current version of Audacity, choose <span class="menu">Help &gt;  <a href="help_menu.html#about_audacity" title="Help Menu">About Audacity</a></span> in the menu <i>(or <span class="menu">Audacity &gt; About Audacity</span> on Mac)</i>. Then go to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://web.audacityteam.org/download/">Audacity download site</a>
and, if needed, download the latest Audacity for your operating system.
</p>
<div id="guide"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manufacturer.27s_guides">Manufacturer's guides</span></h2>
<p>The guides provided with the devices might be confusing, they are written by the device manufacturer rather than by Audacity. Sometimes the guides supplied with the devices are out-of-date or have errors. Here are some errors that you may come across: 
</p>
<ul><li> Many manuals state that you should "select stereo mix for your input".  This is not the case, rather <b>you should be setting the USB device as your input</b>. </li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Audacity Preferences are not under the <span class="menu">File</span> menu</b>, as many manuals state, except in the legacy 1.0.0 version of Audacity which is only appropriate for Mac OS 9 and Windows 95.  Preferences are under the <span class="menu">Edit</span> menu, or under the <span class="menu">Audacity</span> menu on Mac.     </li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>You do not need to select <span class="menu">Start Monitoring</span> each time you launch Audacity</b>, as some manuals urge you to.  Monitoring the input is optional and allows you to hear the device through the computer speakers just like an ordinary turntable, or cassette deck, whenever it's playing, without having to record. If you want to select <span class="menu">Start Monitoring</span>, you need to have the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter</a> enabled (note: <b>NOT</b> the Mixer Toolbar that some guides state). Instructions on this are below.</li></ul>
<div id="setup"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Set_up_Audacity_to_record_from_the_USB_audio_device">Set up Audacity to record from the USB audio device</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Connect_the_USB_device">Connect the USB device</span></h3>
<p>Connect the USB cable of the device to the computer. Connect to an empty USB port on the computer, not to a USB hub (a device that allows multiple USB devices to be connected to one of your computer's USB ports).

<ul style="list-style-image: none; list-style-type: none">
<ul><li>The Recording Device is set to the USB device (in this case the device name, but often called or including the phrase "USB Audio CODEC"). </li>
<li>Recording Channels is set to stereo.</li>
<li>The Playback Device is set to the named speakers of the built-in computer sound device. 
<ul><li>These settings can also be changed in <a href="devices_preferences.html" title="Devices Preferences">Devices Preferences</a>.  </li></ul></li></ul>
Windows calls most USB external devices "microphones". Some higher-end USB recording interfaces may appear as their explicit manufacturer's name. </ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Software_Playthrough">Software Playthrough</span></h3>
<p>Use <span class="menu">Transport &gt; Transport Options &gt; <a href="transport_menu_transport_options.html#software_playthrough_onoff" title="Transport Menu: Transport Options">Software Playthrough (on/off)</a></span> and click <b>"Software Playthrough"</b> to turn it "on" (the checkmark is shown when it is "on"). This setting can also be enabled or disabled in <a href="recording_preferences.html" title="Recording Preferences">Recording Preferences</a>. Software Playthrough lets you hear the turntable through the computer speakers when recording. It also lets you hear the turntable <i>without</i> recording if you turn on monitoring (see the next section below).  
</p>
<div class="note">
<p>If Audacity's Software Playthrough does not produce audio on Mac, try the third-party <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/">LineIn</a> application.
</p>
</div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Monitoring">Monitoring</span></h3>
<p>Enable monitoring to set the recording level
</p>
<ul><li>Turn monitoring on by clicking once on the microphone icon in the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter</a>.
<dl><dd><span title="Recording Meter Toolbar in use, default size"><img alt="Recording Toolbar in use.png" src="../m/images/7/7a/recording_toolbar_in_use.png" width="473" height="33" /></span></dd></dl></li>
<li>In <a href="mixer_toolbar.html" title="Mixer Toolbar">Mixer Toolbar</a>, turn up the left-hand playback volume slider (by the speaker icon). 
<dl><dd><span title="Mixer Toolbar without input selected"><img alt="MixerToolbar.png" src="../m/images/1/15/mixertoolbar.png" width="323" height="27" /></span></dd></dl></li>
<li>The right-hand recording volume slider (by the microphone icon) can often be used to vary the loudness of the recording, but it may not function with all turntables. If it does not, try adjusting the output level on the turntable (often, there is a gain control under the chassis). <p>Alternatively, you may be able to adjust the input level on Windows and Linux only, usually by looking for the speaker icon by the system clock. On <b>Windows</b>, <span class="menu">right-click over the speaker icon &gt; "Recording Devices"</span>. Then right-click over USB Audio Codec, choose "Properties" and click the <i>Levels</i> tab.</p> </li>
<li>Try to aim for a maximum peak of around –6 dB, which corresponds to around 0.5 on the <a href="audacity_waveform.html" title="Audacity Waveform">waveform</a>. You can always boost the level later with <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="amplify.html" title="Amplify">Amplify...</a></span> or <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize...</a></span>  after you have completed editing. </li></ul>
<div class="note"><b>Possible solutions for excessive output volume if there is no gain control on the USB audio device:</b>
<ul><li> <b>If the device has RCA leads</b> for connecting to speakers and your computer has a line-in port (blue), plug the RCA leads into an RCA stereo &gt; 1/8 inch stereo TRS adapter (obtainable from most electronics retailers), then connect the adapter to the line-in. Set Audacity to record from line-in then you can use the Audacity recording slider to control the level. 
<ul><li> If you have no line-in, do not use the microphone (pink) input unless there is a way to switch it to line-level stereo or unless it offers line-level stereo compatibility. </li></ul></li>
<li> <b>If the cartridge is replaceable</b>, take it to a hi-fi shop and see if you can get a lower output cartridge. If the cartridge is ceramic <i>(cheap USB turntables often use these)</i> it will have a high output. Replacing this with a magnetic cartridge will give lower output and better quality. </div></li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Recording">Recording</span></h3>
<p>Then, ignoring any instructions in the manufacturer's guide to select "stereo mix", simply press the <b>Record</b> button <img alt="image of Record button" src="../m/images/e/e8/record.png" title="image of Record button" width="16" height="16" /> in <a href="transport_toolbar.html" title="Transport Toolbar">Transport Toolbar</a> to start recording from the turntable.

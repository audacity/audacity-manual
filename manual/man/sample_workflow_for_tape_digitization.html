					<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><div class="intro">This tutorial outlines a set of example steps using Audacity to digitize tapes (cassette tapes and reel-to-reel) to create files that are ready for CD creation, loading into a digital jukebox or portable music player. There is no fixed "<i><b>right</b></i>" way of working - there are many alternatives; like any recipe, it can be adapted to suit your personal needs.</div>
<p>This workflow does not at any stage necessitate the saving of an <a href="audacity_projects.html" title="Audacity Projects">Audacity project</a> (though you may wish to do that if you need to interrupt your work). Your final goal will be to <a href="export.html" title="Export">export</a> WAV files for CD creation or other file formats which might be more suitable for your needs.
</p><p>While all of the processing in this tutorial is carried out using Audacity, some users may prefer to use <a href="#alternative">alternative software</a> for specific sub-tasks like noise removal and the removal of clicks and pops (Audacity's Click Removal may not give as good a result as other software).
</p><p>For more details of the steps involved in this workflow please see the tutorial set <a href="tutorial_copying_tapes_lps_or_minidiscs_to_cd.html" title="Tutorial - Copying tapes, LPs or minidiscs to CD">Copying tapes, LPs or MiniDiscs to CD</a>.

<div class="note">Making tape to digital transfers is a skill and the more you do the more expert you will become. 
<ul><li>Consider starting out with some tapes that you care less about, this way you will not need to go back and repeat important earlier transcriptions that you made.  </li>
<li>Start with a recording that you are very familiar with; your first goal will be to ensure that you have as perfect a digital copy of the material as possible. </li>
<li>Clean-up steps are optional and need only be applied if your recording requires them.</div></li></ul>

<div id="set"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="1._Audacity_settings">1. Audacity settings</span></h3>
<p>Work with Audacity set to a project rate of 44100 Hz and 32-bit sample format (these are the default <a href="quality_preferences.html" title="Quality Preferences">quality settings</a>). You may use 16-bit if you prefer; it will give smaller working file sizes but you may lose a little quality in some of the processes.  Export WAV files at 44100 Hz 16-bit PCM stereo, the standard required for <a href="burning_music_files_to_a_cd.html" title="Burning music files to a CD"> burning CDs</a>; this will also produce WAVs which are accepted for import by iTunes (and most other music player software).
</p>
<div id="azimuth"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2._Check.2Fadjust_the_azimuth_settings">2. Check/adjust the azimuth settings</span></h3>
<p>Azimuth is the angle of the magnetic gap in the tape head relative to the tape. This should always be 90 degrees, but in practice most cassette decks fail to maintain accurate head position, hence the azimuth of cassette recordings routinely varies. Pre-recorded tapes are much better, but not entirely immune to azimuth variation.
</p><p>Misaligned azimuth routinely causes degradation of high frequencies and signal to noise ratio.
</p><p>See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Recording_from_Cassette#Azimuth">this Wiki page</a> for advice on how to adjust your azimuth setting.
</p>
<div class="note">You do not need to do this every time, but it is worth doing before you start your first tape transfer.</div>
<div id="clean"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="3._Clean_the_heads_and_pinch_roller">3. Clean the heads and pinch roller</span></h3>
<p>Most deposited oxide goes onto the pinch roller. The more oxide there is on this roller, the less able it is to remove and hold loose oxide from the tape, and thus the more oxide gets deposited on the head.
</p><p>A dirty pinch roller has less friction, and can occasionally result in tape slip, degrading playback quality. This is especially true for 8 track tapes, where tape slip is a real issue.
</p><p>All types of tape deck that use a pinch roller should have the roller cleaned occasionally. Microcassettes and picocassettes don't use pinch rollers.
</p>
<div id="tension"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="4._Retension_the_tape">4. Retension the tape</span></h3>
<p>Tape that has been stored unplayed for a long period of time can benefit from having its tension evened out prior to making the playback for recording capture.  
</p><p>To do this simply use the fast forward to advance the tape to the end and rewind to the beginning <i>(but take care with this if you a working with a low-grade deck that has a poor, or no, braking system as this can cause the tape to come off the spool)</i>.  If you have plenty of time you could instead just play the tape at normal speed and then play the second side before making the actual recording.
</p>
<div id="levels"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="5._Recording_levels">5. Recording levels</span></h3>
<p>Read this page about making a <a href="tutorial_making_a_test_recording.html" title="Tutorial - Making a Test Recording">test recording</a> then make a test recording of portions of the tape (or even a whole side) so as to check the levels. It is important to avoid any <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i> during the recording!  Try to aim for a maximum peak of around –6 <i><b><a href="glossary.html#decibel" title="Glossary">dB</a></b></i> (or 0.5 if you have your meter set to linear rather than dB).

<div class="note">Whether you need to use <a href="noise_reduction.html" title="Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a> will depend on the quality of your tapes, your <a href="#azimuth">azimuth setting</a>, the cleanliness of the <a href="#clean">tape heads</a> and your Dolby settings.</div>
<p>Use the <a href="noise_reduction.html" title="Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a> effect's <b>Get Noise Profile</b> to obtain a noise sample from either the lead-in grooves immediately before the music starts, or from a lead-in between tracks. The length is not important but, typically, it will be less than a second; what is important is that you have a true representative sample of the noise without any audio signal at all (such as a very quiet fade lead in). Try amplifying the sample and audition it to ensure that no real audio signal is present.  If it's OK, undo the amplify, then re-apply the Noise Removal effect with these recommended settings:
</p>
<ul><li>Noise reduction - no more than 12 dB (9 dB is a good guideline)</li>
<li>Sensitivity - 6.00</li>
<li>Frequency smoothing (bands) - no more than 6 (3 or lower is a good setting for Music)</li></ul>
<p>Noise reduction is always a compromise because, on the one hand, you can have all the music and a lot of noise and, on the other hand, no noise and only some of the music. Try different settings on the "Noise Reduction (dB)" slider until you get the best compromise.
</p>
<div class="note">Unless you are transcribing tapes that are recordings made from original LPs or 45s you are unlikely to need other noise reduction techniques, but if that is that case you my need to consider the following from the workflow on <a href="sample_workflow_for_lp_digitization.html" title="Sample workflow for LP digitization">LP digitization</a>:

<td align="left" valign="top"><b>Noise Reduction with cassette tapes:</b> Cassettes are slightly different from other sources in that its not uncommon for the noise profile to change through the course of the tape, due to accumulation of dirt on the tape heads, either during play or during record, or both.
<p>To optimize the performance of Audacity's Noise Reduction it is best to use a noise sample near the beginning of the tape rather than the end. Using a sample late in the tape will sometimes cause poorer discrimination between noise and signal, as some of the higher frequency noise will be missing or reduced in amplitude.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="12._Fade_Ins.2FOuts">12. Fade Ins/Outs</span></h3>
<p>You may wish to more cleanly fade-in and fade-out the song beginnings and endings by using <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="fades.html#linearfade" title="Fades">Fade In</a></span> and <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="fades.html#linearfade" title="Fades">Fade Out</a></span>. Normally fade outs should be longer <i>(typically a few seconds)</i>, and fade ins, if required, quite short <i>(typically a fraction of a second)</i>. 
</p><p>Consider using <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="fades.html#studio_fadeout" title="Fades">Studio Fade Out</a></span> instead of the linear <b>Fade Out</b>.  It applies a more musical fade out to the selected audio, giving a more pleasing (more "professional studio") sounding result.
</p><p>You may also get a more musical fade-in by applying <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="fades.html#linearfade" title="Fades">Fade In</a></span> multiple times to the selected audio, three times is a good guideline.  This will produce a shaped, curved, fade rather than a linear one.
</p>
<div class="note">Although no keyboard shortcuts for effects are provided by default in Audacity it is possible to set up your own shortcuts for any effects you choose.  You may find it particularly beneficial to assign shortcuts for <b>Fade In</b> and <b>Fade Out</b> (or <b>Studio Fade Out</b>) as these will used repeatedly for tape digitization.<p>For instructions on how to do this please see the <a href="keyboard_preferences.html" title="Keyboard Preferences">Keyboard Preferences</a> page in the manual.</p></div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="13._Adjust_label_positions">13. Adjust label positions</span></h3>

</p>
<div id="names"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="14._Track_names">14. Track names</span></h3>
<p>Edit the labels for the song names - we suggest using "01 First Song Name", "02 Second Song Name", and so on as this helps keep them in the right order for CD production or loading into iTunes.  You may find that changing the zoom level will help you with this task; you can advance to the next label by ensuring that the focus is in the current label then using <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">TAB</span>.
</p><p>If you wish you may instead automatically prefix named tracks with a sequential two-digit number. <br />To do this, in the "Name files" section of the Export Multiple dialog select the <span class="button">Numbering before Label/Track Name</span> radio button.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="15._Amplitude_adjustment">15. Amplitude adjustment</span></h3>
<p>Normalize the amplitude of the recording; either do each track of the recording individually (especially if the tracks will be randomly played from a library containing many different styles of music) or, do the whole recording at once (which will work fine if all the tracks have the same average volume).  Use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize</a></span> as the last editing step, setting  "Normalize maximum amplitude to" to around -3 dB or similar, to give some headroom below the distortion level.  The Normalize effect can be set to either:
</p>
<ul><li>Adjust the amplitude of both stereo channels by the same amount (thus preserving the original stereo balance), or</li>
<li>Adjust each stereo channel independently (this can be useful if your equipment is not balanced).</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="16._Compression">16. Compression</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="compressor.html" title="Compressor">Compressor</a> effect reduces the dynamic range of audio. One of the main purposes of reducing dynamic range is to permit the audio to be amplified further (without clipping) than would be otherwise possible.
</p><p>Compressor makes the loud parts quieter and (optionally) the quiet parts louder. It can be very useful for listening to classical music in a car. Such music normally has a wide dynamic range and can thus be difficult to listen to in a car without constant volume re-adjustment.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="19._Backup">19. Backup</span></h3>
<p>Backup your exported WAV or MP3 files - you don't want to lose all that valuable work and have to do it all over again, do you? Computer hard drives can fail, destroying all data. 
</p><p>Ideally use a dedicated drive <i>(1+ TB external magnetic drives are convenient and economical)</i>, or upload to an online (cloud) storage service to store the WAVs or MP3s. Better still is to make two copies on different external devices and even better is to hold an online backup as well as the local copies. 
</p><p>You may want to create a taxonomic file structure - for example each album can be stored in its own folder (named for the album) within a folder named for the artist (or, perhaps, composer for classical music) to make searching and retrieval easier.

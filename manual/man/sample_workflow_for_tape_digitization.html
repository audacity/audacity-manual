					<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><div class="intro">This tutorial outlines a set of example steps using Audacity to digitize tapes (cassette tapes and reel-to-reel) to create files that are ready for CD creation, loading into a digital jukebox or portable music player. There is no fixed "<i><b>right</b></i>" way of working - there are many alternatives; like any recipe, it can be adapted to suit your personal needs.</div>
<p>This workflow does not at any stage necessitate the saving of an <a href="audacity_projects.html" title="Audacity Projects">Audacity project</a> (though you may wish to do that if you need to interrupt your work). Your final goal will be to <a href="export.html" title="Export">export</a> WAV files for CD creation or other file formats which might be more suitable for your needs.
</p><p>While all of the processing in this tutorial is carried out using Audacity, some users may prefer to use <a href="#alternative">alternative software</a> for specific sub-tasks like noise removal and the removal of clicks and pops (Audacity's Click Removal may not give as good a result as other software).
</p><p>For more details of the steps involved in this workflow please see the tutorial set <a href="tutorial_copying_tapes_lps_or_minidiscs_to_cd.html" title="Tutorial - Copying tapes, LPs or minidiscs to CD">Copying tapes, LPs or MiniDiscs to CD</a>.

<p>Work with Audacity set to a project rate of 44,100 Hz and 32-bit sample format (these are the default <a href="quality_preferences.html" title="Quality Preferences">quality settings</a>). You may use 16-bit if you prefer; it will give smaller working file sizes but you may lose a little quality in some of the processes.  Export WAV files at 44,100 Hz 16-bit PCM stereo, the standard required for <a href="burning_music_files_to_a_cd.html" title="Burning music files to a CD"> burning CDs</a>; this will also produce WAVs which are accepted for import by Apple Music/iTunes (and most other music player software).

<div id="azimuth"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2._Check.2Fadjust_the_azimuth_settings">2. Check/adjust the azimuth settings</span></h3>
<p>Azimuth is the angle of the magnetic gap in the tape head relative to the tape. This should always be 90 degrees, but in practice most cassette decks fail to maintain accurate head position, hence the azimuth of cassette recordings routinely varies. Pre-recorded tapes are much better, but not entirely immune to azimuth variation.
</p><p>Misaligned azimuth routinely causes degradation of high frequencies and signal to noise ratio.

<p>Most deposited oxide goes onto the pinch roller. The more oxide there is on this roller, the less able it is to remove and hold loose oxide from the tape, and thus the more oxide gets deposited on the head.
</p><p>A dirty pinch roller has less friction, and can occasionally result in tape slip, degrading playback quality. This is especially true for 8 track tapes, where tape slip is a real issue.
</p><p>All types of tape deck that use a pinch roller should have the roller cleaned occasionally. Microcassettes and picocassettes do not use pinch rollers.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="4._Retension_the_tape">4. Retension the tape</span></h3>
<p>Tape that has been stored unplayed for a long period of time can benefit from having its tension evened out prior to making the playback for recording capture.  
</p><p>To do this simply use the fast forward to advance the tape to the end and rewind to the beginning <i>(but take care with this if you a working with a low-grade deck that has a poor, or no, braking system as this can cause the tape to come off the spool)</i>.  If you have plenty of time you could instead just play the tape at normal speed and then play the second side before making the actual recording.

It is important to avoid any <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i> during the recording!  Try to aim for a maximum peak of around \xe2\x80\x936 <i><b><a href="glossary.html#decibel" title="Glossary">dB</a></b></i> (or 0.5 if you have your meter set to linear rather than dB).

<div class="note">Whether you need to use <a href="noise_reduction.html" title="Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a> will depend on the quality of your tapes, your <a href="#azimuth">azimuth setting</a>, the cleanliness of the <a href="#clean">tape heads</a> and your Dolby settings.</div>
<p>Use the <a href="noise_reduction.html" title="Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a> effect's <b>Get Noise Profile</b> to obtain a noise sample from either the lead-in grooves immediately before the music starts, or from a lead-in between tracks. The length is not important but, typically, it will be less than a second; what is important is that you have a true representative sample of the noise without any audio signal at all (such as a very quiet fade lead in). Try amplifying the sample and audition it to ensure that no real audio signal is present.  If it is OK, undo the amplify, then re-apply the Noise Removal effect with these recommended settings:
</p>
<ul><li>Noise reduction - no more than 12 dB (9 dB is a good guideline)</li>
<li>Sensitivity - 6.00</li>
<li>Frequency smoothing (bands) - no more than 6 (3 or lower is a good setting for Music)</li></ul>
<p>Noise reduction is always a compromise because, on the one hand, you can have all the music and a lot of noise and, on the other hand, no noise and only some of the music. Try different settings on the "Noise Reduction (dB)" slider until you get the best compromise.
</p>
<div class="note">Unless you are transcribing tapes that are recordings made from original LPs or 45s you are unlikely to need other noise reduction techniques, but if that is that case you my need to consider the following from the workflow on <a href="sample_workflow_for_lp_digitization.html" title="Sample workflow for LP digitization">LP digitization</a>:

<td align="left" valign="top"><b>Noise Reduction with cassette tapes:</b> Cassettes are slightly different from other sources in that its not uncommon for the noise profile to change through the course of the tape, due to accumulation of dirt on the tape heads, either during play or during record, or both.
<p>To optimize the performance of Audacity's Noise Reduction it is best to use a noise sample near the beginning of the tape rather than the end. Using a sample late in the tape will sometimes cause poorer discrimination between noise and signal, as some of the higher frequency noise will be missing or reduced in amplitude.

Normally fade outs should be longer <i>(typically a few seconds)</i>, and fade ins, if required, quite short <i>(typically a fraction of a second)</i>. 
</p><p>Consider using <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="fades.html#studio_fadeout" title="Fades">Studio Fade Out</a></span> instead of the linear <b>Fade Out</b>.  It applies a more musical fade out to the selected audio, giving a more pleasing (more "professional studio") sounding result.
</p><p>You may also get a more musical fade-in by applying <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="fades.html#linearfade" title="Fades">Fade In</a></span> multiple times to the selected audio, three times is a good guideline.  This will produce a shaped, curved, fade rather than a linear one.
</p>
<div class="note">Although no keyboard shortcuts for effects are provided by default in Audacity it is possible to set up your own shortcuts for any effects you choose.  You may find it particularly beneficial to assign shortcuts for <b>Fade In</b> and <b>Fade Out</b> (or <b>Studio Fade Out</b>) as these will used repeatedly for tape digitization.<p>For instructions on how to do this please see the <a href="keyboard_preferences.html" title="Keyboard Preferences">Keyboard Preferences</a> page in the manual.</p></div>

</p><p>Ideally use a dedicated drive <i>(1+ TB external magnetic drives are convenient and economical)</i>, or upload to an online (cloud) storage service to store the WAVs or MP3s. Better still is to make two copies on different external devices and even better is to hold an online backup as well as the local copies. 
</p><p>You may want to create a taxonomic file structure - for example each album can be stored in its own folder (named for the album) within a folder named for the artist (or, perhaps, composer for classical music) to make searching and retrieval easier.

<ul><li><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.clickrepair.net">DeNoise</a></b>:  This is a <i>(paid for, but with a free-trial period)</i> third-party tool effective at removing noise and hiss.  Some new users may find it intimidating as an entry level tool. Users report that settings normally have to be reset for each recording to optimize the noise removal thus making it difficult to use in a semi-automated way.</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Compression">Compression</span></h3>
<p>Please see <a href="chris_s_dynamic_compressor.html" title="Chris's Dynamic Compressor">Chris's Dynamic Compressor</a> for a popular alternative compressor which may be downloaded for free.  It works by trying to even out abrupt changes of volume by employing "lookahead" <i>(this attempts to anticipate volume changes by starting to apply compression before the volume rises to the threshold level)</i>. It has options to soften the softer audio and invert loudness.

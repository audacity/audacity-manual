<div class="intro">Most modern Linux desktop systems use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</a> sound system, which provide virtual "Monitor" inputs for each output device. The "Monitor" devices provide a means to record the audio that is playing out of that device. An alternative sound system available to Linux is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit">JACK</a>, which provides a high performance, low latency sound system for professional use. Jack Audio System can be difficult to set up, so is not generally recommended for beginners - If you wish to use it, refer your distribution's documentation for details of how to correctly install Jack. </div>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="PulseAudio">PulseAudio</span></h2>
<p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a> is a sound server providing professional audio features such as mixing and input/output routing. It is the default audio device on many Linux distributions including <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> and many Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions. PulseAudio operates as a proxy between sound applications and the audio hardware (usually via ALSA). PulseAudio Volume Control  provides a "Monitor" device which listens for the audio output of other applications such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/">Rhythmbox</a>. Setting PulseAudio Volume Control to capture from the Monitor device lets Audacity record computer playback when its input device is set to pulse.  
</p>
<ol>
<li> If not already installed, add PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) to your system. This is usually available in the distribution's repository. 
<li> Ensure that PulseAudio is running. In Audacity's <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a>, set the Host to <b>ALSA</b> and the recording device to <b>pulse</b>. 
<ul><li> On systems where PulseAudio is the default sound system the recording device may be set to <b>default</b>.
<li>Audacity's playback device may be set to <b>pulse</b> or to any available audio interface.</ul>
<dl><dd><span title="Recording device set to pulse in Device Toolbar"><img alt="Pulse-device-toolbar.png" src="../m/images/4/48/pulse_device_toolbar.png" width="624" height="29" /></span></dd></dl>
<li>Ensure that "Software Playthrough" is not enabled in the <a href="transport_menu.html" title="Transport Menu">Transport Menu</a> then left-click on the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter</a> to turn monitoring on.
<li>Open PulseAudio Volume Control and choose the "Recording" tab.
<li>In the "Capture <i>from</i>" dropdown, select the "Monitor" option of the playback device used by the application you want to record from, as shown below:
<dl><dd><span title="Capture from Monitor device"><img alt="Pavucontrol-CaptureMonitor.png" src="../m/images/1/1b/pavucontrol_capturemonitor.png" width="715" height="333" /></span></dd></dl>
<li>Launch the application that you wish to record and begin playback. 
<li>In the "Recording" tab of PulseAudio Volume Control, drag the volume sliders so that the recording level in Audacity's Recording Meter is to left of 0 <i><b><a href="glossary.html#decibel" title="Glossary">dB</a></b></i> (-6 dB is a good level to aim for). 
<ul><li>The playback level of the application being recorded will also affect the level of the recording. Use the "Playback" tab in PulseAudio Volume Control or the volume control in the application to adjust the output level.
<li>If you want to record without hearing the audio, you can turn down the Audacity playback slider or turn down the sliders on the Output Devices tab of PulseAudio Volume Control. Do not use the Mute button in PulseAudio Volume Control, because this will cause Audacity to record silence. You can also set the port on the Output Devices tab of PulseAudio volume control to the audio output such as "headphones" but not connect any headphones or speakers to the port. </ul>
<li>When the recording level has been correctly adjusted, press the Record button in Audacity .</ol>
<p>For a detailed description using Ubuntu 10, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Stereo_mix_with_Ubuntu_10">Stereo Mix with Ubuntu 10</a> on the Audacity wiki.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="JACK">JACK</span></h2>
<p>Jack Audio System is commonly used in Linux distributions that specialise in media creation such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ubuntustudio.org/">Ubuntu Studio</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.64studio.com/">Studio&#160;64</a>.
</p><p>To use Audacity with Jack it is useful or in some cases essential to have a few additional packages installed. This documentation assumes that you have Jack Audio System working on your machine. For help with setting up Jack, please consult the documentation for your Linux distribution.
</p><p>Recording sounds playing from other applications is rather easy with Jack. Jack may be started using QjackCtl or from the command-line. If Audacity is launched after Jack is started then "Jack Audio Connection Kit" will be an available host option in the <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a>. If Jack is started after Audacity has been launched then it will be necessary to <span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu.html#rescan_audio_devices" title="Transport Menu">Rescan Audio Devices</a></span> for new audio devices before jack is available to Audacity.
</p><p>Any Jack-compatible applications that are running before Audacity is launched will have their ports available in Device Toolbar. To make an application available to Audacity that is launched after Audacity it is necessary to use Rescan Audio Devices in the Transport Menu. After rescanning audio devices, input and output ports from other applications will be available in the Recording and Playback boxes in Device Toolbar.
</p><p>In this image the output of Hydrogen drum machine is being selected as the recording source. This will enable Audacity to record directly from the audio output from Hydrogen. If "System" is selected as the recording source then Audacity will record from the physical audio interface input.
</p>
<dl><dd><span title="Selecting the recording source in Device Toolbar"><img alt="Select Jack recording input.png" src="../m/images/9/98/select_jack_recording_input.png" width="600" height="106" /></span></dd></dl>
<p>Applications that do not directly support Jack may also be used with Jack on a system that uses PulseAudio (such as Ubuntu and Debian based distributions) by installing "pulseaudio-module-jack". This provides the modules "Jack Source" and "Jack Sink" that allow PulseAudio to use Jack. For example, to record sounds playing through Firefox, PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) can be used to direct the output from Firefox to Jack Sink. The recording input for Audacity can then be set to record from "PulseAudio Jack Sink" and the sound will be recorded.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_programs_for_recording_computer_playback">Alternative programs for recording computer playback</span></h3>
<p>An alternative to recording streaming audio from the Internet is to download the data directly to disk, either by using command-line tools such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://streamripper.sourceforge.net/">streamripper</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a>, or with a browser plug-in (many available for Firefox), or writing the stream to disk from a media player such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.xmms.org/">xmms</a>, or using a graphical down-loader such as <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nongnu.org/streamtuner/">streamtuner</a>.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<div id="loopback"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_a_loopback_cable">Use a loopback cable</span></h2>
<p>This is a simple and effective method of recording what is playing on the computer. It has the disadvantage that the audio signal is converted from digital to analog, then from analog to digital, instead of staying in the digital domain. This may result in some slight increase in noise and distortion.
</p><p>Plug your line-out or headphones-out to the line-in using a cable with a stereo mini-plug at each end, then record from line-in. To hear the sound while recording, use a single to double stereo connector to give you a jack for the speakers or headphones.
</p><p>If you have only mic-in and no line-in is selectable through alsamixer, you can build an <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/line_to_mic.html">attenuator</a> to reduce the line level output to a level suitable for mic-in. But probably this will only provide mono recording, because mic-in is mono in most cases. As well, the quality may be questionable.

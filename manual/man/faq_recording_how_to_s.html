<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_record_in_stereo.3F">How can I record in stereo?</span></h2>
<p>Audacity by default should already be set to record in stereo.  If this is not the case, use <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> to select the playback and recording devices and to set the channels to <b>"2 (stereo) Recording Channels"</b>.
</p><p>Alternatively you can open the <a href="preferences.html" title="Preferences">Audacity Preferences</a>, choose the “<a href="devices_preferences.html" title="Devices Preferences">Devices</a>” section on the left, then in the "Recording" panel, change the number of recording channels to "2 (Stereo)".
{{note|<b>Windows:</b> Many USB recording devices, even if stereo, are seen as "microphones" so set by Windows to record in mono. If Audacity is set to record in stereo this will cause both channels to have the same content as one of the channels. To set Windows to record the device in stereo:
</p>
<ul><li>By the system clock, right-click over the <span class="menu">Speaker icon</span> select <span class="menu">Sounds</span> then the <span class="menu">Recording</span> tab, and then click on the <b>USB device</b> in the list and click <span class="button">Properties</span>. Click the <span class="menu">Advanced</span> tab set your required bit rate and sample rate from the <b>Default Format</b> dropdown (normally <b>"2 channel 16-bit 44100 Hz"</b>).</li></ul>
<p>For a more detailed walk-through of the above steps for Windows <i>(or if that does not work for your version of Windows)</i>, see <b><a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls</a>.</b>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_an_optimal_recording_level_to_aim_for.3F">What is an optimal recording level to aim for?</span></h2>
<p>Using the Recording Volume Slider on <a href="mixer_toolbar.html" title="Mixer Toolbar">Mixer Toolbar</a> to adjust the level, aim for a maximum peak of around –6 <i><b><a href="glossary.html#decibel" title="Glossary">dB</a></b></i> on the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter</a> (or 0.5 if the meter is set to <i><b><a href="glossary.html#linear" title="Glossary">linear</a></b></i> scale). This should ensure that <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i> will be avoided. The recording will only show a maximum peak of around 0.5 on the default <a href="audacity_waveform.html" title="Audacity Waveform">waveform</a> display, but given how the ear hears sound, this is actually much louder than apparent "half volume". 
</p><p>You can boost the level if necessary after recording and editing by using <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="amplify.html" title="Amplify">Amplify</a></span> or <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize</a></span>.

<ol><li>Set Audacity to <a href="#How_can_I_record_in_stereo.3F">record in stereo</a>.</li>
<li>Plug one end of a stereo cable into the "Line Out" or "Headphone" connector on your tape deck, MiniDisc player, or stereo system. Plug the other end into your computer’s "Line In" port. If you do not have a suitable cable, you can find one at an electronics store.</li>
<li>Choose "Line In" as the recording source in Audacity's <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> or <a href="devices_preferences.html" title="Devices Preferences">Devices Preferences</a>. </li>
<li>Press the red <b>Record</b> button. While Audacity is recording, start playing your tape or disc. When you have captured the audio you want to record, press the <b>Stop</b> button. You can also press the <b>Pause</b> button to pause recording, and Pause again to resume recording on the same track.</li></ol>
<p>For a detailed tutorial, see <a href="tutorial_copying_tapes_lps_or_minidiscs_to_cd.html" title="Tutorial - Copying tapes, LPs or minidiscs to CD">Copying tapes, LPs or MiniDiscs to CD</a>. This covers all the steps from recording your records, cassettes or MiniDiscs to exporting as an audio file and burning to an <a href="burning_music_files_to_a_cd.html" title="Burning music files to a CD">audio CD</a>. 
</p><p>Vinyl or shellac records can also be recorded into Audacity with a special type of turntable that connects to the USB port of your computer. These turntables need to be set up differently from those that connect to line-in. See <a href="recording_with_usb_turntables.html" title="Recording with USB turntables">Recording with USB turntables or USB cassette decks</a> for setup instructions, then <a href="basic_recording_editing_and_exporting.html" title="Basic Recording, Editing and Exporting">Basic Recording, Editing and Exporting</a> in the main tutorial. 
</p>
<div class="note">
<p><b>Connection hints:</b>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Do not connect a turntable directly to your computer.</b> The signal from a turntable must be passed through a phono pre-amplifier or a receiver with a “phono” input that provides phono amplification. Otherwise, it will be too quiet and will also sound "tinny" due to incorrect equalization.  </li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Do not plug stereo equipment into your computer’s “Microphone” port.</b> This port is usually designed only for low level, mono microphone input. It will produce distortion if you connect phono amplified output. Use the “Line In” port if you have one (on some laptops or other portable computers, the "Mic" port can be switched to a line-level input). See <a href="how_to_connect_your_equipment.html#avoid_mic" title="How to connect your equipment">further help</a>.  </li></ul>

<p>This is known as recording an <i><b>overdub</b></i> to create a <i><b>multi-track</b></i> recording. It makes it possible to record harmonies with yourself, or add new instruments or vocals to an existing recording. To do this in Audacity, follow these instructions:
</p>
<ol><li>Select the recording device you are plugged into (probably microphone or line-in) in the Recording Device menu in <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> 
<ul><li> If you do not see your required recording device, enable it and make it default in the operating system's mixer. For Windows see <a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls</a>. To locate the system mixer for Mac and Linux see the help on our Wiki for <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X">Mac</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Linux_System_Mixer">Linux</a>, then in Audacity, choose<span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu.html#rescan_audio_devices" title="Transport Menu">Rescan Audio Devices</a></span>     </li></ul></li>
<li><a href="importing_audio.html" title="Importing Audio">Import</a> or record the first track </li>
<li>Choose {<span class="menu">Transport &gt; Transport Options &gt; <a href="transport_menu_transport_options.html#overdub_onoff" title="Transport Menu: Transport Options">Overdub (on/off)</a></span></li>
<li>Press the <b>Record</b> button <img alt="Record button image" src="../m/images/e/e8/record.png" title="Record button image" width="16" height="16" />&#160;.</li></ol>
<div class="note">If you are recording from a microphone, make sure you use headphones so that the microphone picks up only what you are recording.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_the_maximum_recording_length.3F">What is the maximum recording length?</span></h2>
<p>Audacity does not restrict the maximum recording length beyond the practical limitation that recording takes space on your drive so you can only record while the drive still has space available. 
</p><p>When you start to record, Audacity shows a "Disk space remains for recording" message in the <a href="status_bar.html" title="Status Bar">Status Bar</a> at bottom left of the Audacity window giving the current recording time available. With default Audacity settings, stereo recording takes 1.2 GB of space per hour. 
</p>
<div class="note">After recording you will still need space to <a href="file_export_dialog.html" title="File Export Dialog">export</a> the recording as an audio file for your computer. Editing the recording before export takes extra space. Each edit of a region requires as much extra disk space as was required to originally record that section.</div>
<p>To get more recording time:
</p>
<ul><li> Delete your old files and folders (especially your old <a href="audacity_projects.html" title="Audacity Projects">Audacity Project</a> files and _data folders when you have finished with them)</li>
<li> Select an alternative drive that has more space in the <a href="directories_preferences.html" title="Directories Preferences">Directories Preferences</a> (but do not record to an external USB or Firewire disk because recording needs disk access to be as fast as possible)</li>
<li> Record in mono instead of stereo (settable at "Recording Channels" in <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> or in <a href="devices_preferences.html" title="Devices Preferences">Devices Preferences</a>)</li>
<li> Set the "Default Sample Format" in <a href="quality_preferences.html" title="Quality Preferences">Quality Preferences</a> to 16-bit instead of 32-bit (this is a good choice for a "quick recording" which you export at once without editing).</li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Can_I_record_from_a_multi-channel_device_.28more_than_stereo.29.3F">Can I record from a multi-channel device (more than stereo)?</span></h2>
<p>Yes, but this is not simple; typically this does not work "out of the box" on Windows consumer systems, and always requires use of appropriate hardware and device drivers. There are some known Audacity limitations in channel selection and channel-to-track allocation. It is essential that sample rates are matched in all places (Audacity, the operating system and the device).   
See <a href="multi_channel_recording.html" title="Multi-channel Recording">Multi-channel Recording</a> for more details.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Can_I_record_from_two_microphones_.28or_two_audio_interfaces.29_at_the_same_time.3F">Can I record from two microphones (or two audio interfaces) at the same time?</span></h2>
<p>Audacity can only record from one sound device at a time, but here are some solutions.  
</p>
<ul>
<li> If your sound device has separate left and right mic inputs, connect the separate microphones to those inputs.
<li>Connect the separate microphones to a mixer and record from the mixer. 
<li> If these are dynamic microphones that do not need extra power, buy an adaptor that has two inputs for the microphones with a single 1/8 inch TRS connector for the computer microphone port (this will usually only give you a combined mono input).  
<li> Record each track to different computers.
<li> If you have two USB microphones or any other separate sound devices you can aggregate them as a single device for recording in Audacity, or use other recording software to record the two devices to separate tracks.
<ul><li>On <b>Windows</b> you can try the following.
<ul><li>Some applications can route two devices to one stream. Use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Voicemeeter/index.htm">Voice Meeter</a> (donationware - see this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://youtu.be/atobXq-iA-k">YouTube video tutorial</a>) or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.htm">Virtual Audio Cable</a> (not free).
<li> It may also be possible on Windows to use the "Listen" feature to route inputs to the output, though this is slightly lossy.
<ol><li>Right-click over the speaker icon by the system clock, choose "Sound" then choose "Recording devices".
<li>Right-click over the first device, choose "Properties" then the "Listen" tab (if available). 
<li> Check "Listen to this device" and set it to play through the required audio interface. 
<li> Repeat the steps for the other devices. 
<li> Use the "stereo mix" feature on your audio interface (if it has such a feature) to <a href="tutorial_recording_computer_playback_on_windows.html" title="Tutorial - Recording Computer Playback on Windows">record the computer playback</a>.</ol>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/alis/">Alis</a> can capture simultaneous recordings from different audio interfaces. 
<li><b>Advanced:</b> Compiling Audacity with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/ASIO_Audio_Interface">ASIO</a> support will allow you to aggregate two USB microphones, for example using the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.asio4all.com/">ASIO4ALL</a> driver for WDM Audio. Aggregating two devices that use ASIO drivers is unlikely to work correctly.</ul>
<li>On <b>Mac OS X</b> use Audio MIDI Setup to aggregate devices. See detailed instructions for  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202000">OS X 10.7 or later</a>.
<li>On <b>Linux</b> you can use JACK to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://jackaudio.org/faq/multiple_devices.html">route two devices to one stream</a> that Audacity can record from. See also these two Forum posts<br /><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=56492&amp;p=146769p142160#p142160">https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=56492&amp;p=146769p142160#p142160</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=56492&amp;p=146769p142160#p146769">https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=56492&amp;p=146769p142160#p146769</a> .</ul>
<div class="note">Separate audio devices such as two USB microphones or devices on different computers will have separate clock speeds (in the absence of a master clock to synchronize to). Therefore the two inputs may drift apart over time.</div>

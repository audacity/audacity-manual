<p>Same as "Save Project" above, but allows you to save a copy of an open project to a different name or location. This can be useful if you want to preserve a copy of the state of a project at a particular time, then proceed to make further changes to the new renamed project you just saved.

</p><p>This is the safe and recommended way to make a safety backup copy of a project as you work on it. This could serve either as  as one of several incremental copies of the project in the state it had at a particular date and time. Unlike "Save As..." using this command will leave your current project open enabling you to continue working on it.
</p><p>You cannot backup a project to overwrite any existing project name within the target folder, you must specify a new unique name.  
</p><p>Unlike with active projects, it is fine to backup projects to a USB disk/stick, a networked device, cloud storage or even a CD-R, but if you need to restore a backup copy to do further work on it then you should copy the backup to a disk on your computer.

<p>For example, if you have used <span class="menu">Analyze &gt; <a href="analyze_menu.html#sound_detection" title="Analyze Menu">Sound Finder...</a></span> to label all very loud sounds in a piece of audio (such as unwanted beeps or advertisements in a radio broadcast) you can use a Labeled Audio command to remove all those sounds in one go.

<p>The commands apply to all <a href="label_tracks.html" title="Label Tracks">labeled</a> audio regions that are <i>fully inside</i> a <a href="audacity_selection.html" title="Audacity Selection">selection</a> drawn in a label track. The selection may extend beyond the label boundaries, but audio that is not labeled and audio whose region label is only partly within the selection will not be acted on.
</p>
<ul><li> Region labels that touch each other without overlapping are treated as separate labeled regions.</li>
<li> If two or more region labels overlap, they are treated as one labeled region.</li>
<li> Labeled Audio Split can mark audio splits at point labels as well as at region labels. </li></ul>
<p>To enable the Labeled Audio commands in the Edit menu, the selection must be made in the Label Track and must fully include (or extend beyond) at least one region label, or must touch (or extend beyond) at least one point label.  
</p><p>If none of the audio tracks are included in the selection, the Labeled Audio commands apply to all audio tracks in the project. However if you include only certain audio tracks in the selection, the Labeled Audio commands will only affect those selected audio tracks. See the <a href="edit_menu_labels.html#examples" title="Edit Menu: Labels">examples</a> below for a demonstration of the difference between selecting in the label track only versus selecting in the label track and one or more audio tracks.

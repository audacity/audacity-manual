<p>If it sounds like recording is skipping, or small fragments are sometimes missing, this means that Audacity cannot write the audio to disk fast enough to keep up with what it is recording. You may not hear skips while listening during the recording, but you will hear them on playback.

<li> <b>Increase the default "Buffer length" setting</b> of 100 milliseconds in <a href="devices_preferences.html" title="Devices Preferences">Devices Preferences</a>.</li></ul>
<div class="note">
<p>On Mac using Mavericks or later, it may be necessary to <i>reduce</i> audio to buffer, possibly to zero.
</p>
</div>
<ul><li> <b>Reduce the amount of audio data being written:</b> Choose 16-bit Sample Format in <a href="quality_preferences.html" title="Quality Preferences">Quality Preferences</a> and set recording channels to mono in <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> (unless you need stereo). Either of these actions halves the amount of data Audacity otherwise has to write. A single instrument or solo vocal should usually be recorded in mono and can be panned in the stereo field later using <a href="audio_track_dropdown_menu.html" title="Audio Track Dropdown Menu">Audio Track Dropdown Menu</a>.</li>
<li> <b>Use a local drive with sufficient space:</b> Set the path to the Audacity <a href="directories_preferences.html" title="Directories Preferences">temporary directory</a> to a local hard drive because these are usually faster than external USB drives. Choose the local drive with the most space. Audacity tells you how much longer you can record for (based on available disk space) in the Status Bar at the bottom of the window.       </li></ul>
<p><b>Computer and hardware</b> 
</p><p>There are many possible actions you can take. Some may have no effect on a skipping problem, others may have a cumulative beneficial effect, so try them all. 
</p>
<ul><li> Quit as many other other applications or processes as possible. In particular, stop anti-virus applications scanning the Audacity <a href="directories_preferences.html" title="Directories Preferences">Temporary Directory</a>. Disconnect from the Internet.</li>
<li> On Windows, regularly defragment your hard disk drive (this should happen automatically on Windows, but do not schedule defragmentation during a recording). Disable Windows Update while recording. Consider creating hardware or software profiles that load only essential hardware and services for a recording session. </li>
<li> Set Audacity to a higher priority in the operating system.   </li>
<li> If you are using a USB recording device. connect directly to a USB port, not a hub.</li>
<li> Whatever the audio device, ensure it has the latest <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Updating_Sound_Device_Drivers">drivers</a> as supplied by the motherboard or device manufacturer (as appropriate).   </li>
<li> A faster processor or more <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> could help solve the problem. </li>
<li> Set <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/DMA_mode">DMA mode</a> for the hard drive on Windows and Linux, hardware acceleration for the video card and avoid sound card interrupt sharing. </li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_can.27t_I_record_in_Windows.3F">Why can't I record in Windows?</span></h2>
<p>On Windows systems, you may receive "Error while opening sound device" when you try to record. This typically happens when you first use Audacity for recording and have no audio input devices (or only the built-in microphone) showing in <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a>.  See <a href="error_opening_sound_device.html" title="Error opening sound device">Error opening sound device</a> for more details on this error.
</p><p>If your <a href="device_toolbar.html#host" title="Device Toolbar">Audio Host</a> is not already set to <a href="glossary.html#mme" title="Glossary">MME</a> <i>(the Audacity default)</i> in Device Toolbar, try changing it to MME as this host is the most compatible with all audio devices. 
</p><p>To investigate this further, exit Audacity then on Windows, right-click over the <span class="menu">Speaker icon</span> by the system clock and choose <span class="menu">Sounds</span> the click the <span class="menu">Recording</span> tab. Follow the steps on  <a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls</a> to show then enable all disconnected and disabled recording devices. 
</p><p>Many new Windows laptop, notebook or netbook computers only have a single audio input port. This will often be a mono port only meant for microphones. On some machines this single port may also be able to accept stereo line level input which is essential to record from standalone cassette decks or home audio systems. However the stereo quality or separation may be poor.  See "<a href="how_to_connect_your_equipment.html" title="How to connect your equipment">How to connect your equipment</a>" before connecting high output devices to a sole input. 
</p>
<div class="note"><b>Windows 10 privacy settings</b>
<p>For some users Windows 10 is now blocking Audacity from using the microphone, on the basis of privacy settings (and this can also affect non-microphone devices). After upgrading to version 1803, some users have been reporting that the microphone is getting detected, but it does not pick up any sound.
</p><p>In order to get around this issue, Microsoft recommends that you need to enable the microphone in your Privacy settings using these steps:
</p>
<ol><li> Open <b>Settings</b></li>
<li> Click on <b>Privacy</b></li>
<li> Click on <b>Microphone</b></li>
<li> Turn on the <b>Allow apps to access your microphone</b> toggle switch.</li></ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_do_I_get_a_flat_line_and_no_sound_when_I_record_on_Mac.3F">Why do I get a flat line and no sound when I record on Mac?</span></h2>
<p>A problem of no recording level in Audacity is occurring quite frequently on Mojave and Catalina, due to Apple changing the <b>Privacy</b> settings for recording devices (making it more conservative, "safer"). Note that, although macOS refers to this setting as <b>Microphone</b>, it applies to all recording devices, including external USB / Thunderbolt interfaces.
</p><p>To fix this problem: 
</p>
<ol><li>On your Mac, choose <span class="menu">Apple menu &gt; System Preferences</span> then click <span class="menu">Security &amp; Privacy</span> in the left-hand menu and the click the <b>Privacy</b> tab.</li>
<li>Click <span class="menu">Microphone</span> in the left-hand menu.</li>
<li>Select the checkbox next to an application (Audacity) to allow it to access the microphone. </li></ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_prevent_clicky_recordings_on_Mac.3F">How can I prevent clicky recordings on Mac?</span></h2>
<p>There are several possible fixes. 
</p>
<ul><li> Open <a href="devices_preferences.html" title="Devices Preferences">Devices Preferences</a> and adjust the "Buffer Length" setting. Reduce the setting to 0 milliseconds. If recording breaks up or does not start, increase "Buffer Length" in increments of 10 milliseconds until recording is smooth.   </li>
<li> If you are recording from an external USB or FireWire interface, open /Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup and select the device. On the Input tab, make sure that the sample rate and number of channels matches with those chosen in Audacity. </li>
<li> Turn off WiFi.</li>
<li> Mitigate power saving features in Mavericks or later that can interfere with recordings.  
<ul><li>  Right-click or Control-click Audacity.app then "Get Info" and enable the "Prevent App Nap" checkbox. This should prevent the Mac putting Audacity into a paused state when it does not have focus.   </li></ul></li></ul>

<p><b>Built-in audio devices</b>
</p><p>Generally, if you connect a cable to one of the inputs of the built-in audio device, Audacity will be able to record immediately from that device. If not: 
</p>
<ul><li>On Windows go to the <a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">"Sound" control panel</a> and make sure the device is enabled. </li>
<li>On Mac, you can configure devices in <span class="path">/Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup.app</span>. </li>
<li>On Linux systems that use <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a>, install and open PulseAudio Volume Control. Restart Audacity after making changes to system audio.</li></ul>
<p>On systems with only one audio port for both input and output, you may need to change the output to an input. On Windows you can do that in the audio interface's own control panel. On Mac, use the Input tab of "Sound" in System Preferences and change the \xe2\x80\x9cUse audio port for:" menu to "Sound Input". 
</p>
<div id="new_external"></div>
<p><b>External audio devices</b>
</p><p>Audacity does not automatically search for new external playback or recording devices (such as headsets, turntables or microphones that connect by USB cable) if you connect these while Audacity is already running. To solve this, make sure the device is <a href="#detect">detected by the operating system</a>, then either restart Audacity or use <span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu.html#rescan_audio_devices" title="Transport Menu">Rescan Audio Devices</a></span> in the Audacity <a href="menu_reference.html" title="Menu Reference">Menu Bar</a>.

<p>To listen while Audacity is recording, enable what is known as software or hardware playthrough as explained below. If you use software playthrough and want to listen to the input without recording it, you must also left-click in the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter Toolbar</a> to turn on <a href="meter_toolbar.html#monitoring" title="Meter Toolbar">monitoring</a>.   
</p><p>In the <a href="recording_preferences.html" title="Recording Preferences">Recording</a> section on the left, put a checkmark in the \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware Playthrough\xe2\x80\x9d box and click OK.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_there_a_delay_or_echo_when_listening_to_what_I_am_recording.3F">Why is there a delay or echo when listening to what I am recording?</span></h2>
<p><a href="recording_preferences.html#playthrough" title="Recording Preferences">Software playthrough</a> usually causes a delay (latency) of the live recording input due to the time it takes to reach your headphones. To prevent this, turn software playthrough off. This can be done most conveniently by choosing <span class="menu">Transport &gt; Transport Options &gt; <a href="transport_menu_transport_options.html#software_playthrough_onoff" title="Transport Menu: Transport Options">Software Playthrough (on/off)</a></span> and clicking it to remove the check (tick) mark.
</p><p>To listen to the live recording input without playthrough latency requires <b>hardware</b> monitoring - that is; the input signal must be routed directly through the audio device from the input to the output rather than being passed through software from input to output.
</p><p>Enabling hardware monitoring is not possible with all audio devices. In particular it can only be achieved when the same device is used for input and output. For example, monitoring a USB microphone through headphones that are plugged into a different audio device will always have latency. If hardware playthrough is not available with your hardware it may be necessary to listen to the audio source directly (acoustically) rather than through the computer.

<p>This issue can occur on newer Windows machines and can occasionally occur on newer Mac computers. These and other symptoms can also occur on other machines if the sound device is applying an effect or a corrective enhancement. 
</p>
<ul><li> If the recording is fading out after a few seconds, look for a "<b>Noise Suppression</b>" setting you can turn off in the <i>Recording</i> side of the sound device settings. </li>
<li> If the recording sounds like it was made in a tunnel, look for an "<b>Echo Cancellation</b>" setting you can turn off. 
<ul><li> If there is no echo cancellation setting or it does not help, look for "<b>Environment</b>" sound effects in the <i>Playback</i> side of the sound device settings - these will affect recordings of computer playback and sometimes other recordings too.   </li></ul></li></ul>
<p><b>Windows</b>:
see <a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls</a>     
</p><p><b>Mac</b>:
</p>
<ol><li> Navigate <span class="menu">Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Hardware &gt; Sound</span> </li>
<li> Choose the "Input" tab and ensure that "Use ambient noise reduction" is unchecked. You may have to select the built-in internal microphone to make this checkbox visible. If checked, it may apply effects to external microphones as well as the internal microphone.  </li></ol>

<p>When you make an <a href="faq_recording_how_to_s.html#overdub" title="FAQ:Recording - How To's">overdub recording</a> (listening to an existing track while recording a new one), computers cannot lay down what you record at the exact instant you sing or play in response to the beat. Therefore without intervention, the recording inevitably gets laid down after the beat. Audacity tries to correct for this "recording latency" automatically by pushing the recorded track backwards after recording stops, but further adjustment may be needed. 
</p><p>If a new track is not synchronized with the others, you can zoom in and use its <a href="audacity_tracks_and_clips.html#move" title="Audacity Tracks and Clips">Clip-handle drag-bar</a>. to drag the track to the correct location. If you are doing a lot of overdubbing, try our <a href="latency_test.html" title="Latency Test">Latency Test</a> to set a custom value for Audacity's latency correction which can then be applied in <a href="devices_preferences.html" title="Devices Preferences">Devices Preferences</a>.
</p>
<div class="note"><a href="tutorial_recording_multi_track_overdubs.html" title="Tutorial - Recording Multi-track Overdubs">Tutorial - Recording Multi-track Overdubs</a> gives a step-by-step 
guide for manually correcting for latency. </div>
<p>Recording while playing is much more demanding for the sound device than simply recording. Hardware and sound driver problems or <i><b><a href="glossary.html#sample_rate" title="Glossary">sample&#160;rate</a></b></i> mismatches between Audacity, the operating system and the sound device can cause poor audio quality or make tracks play and record at different speeds. If a new track is being recorded at a different speed, it will progressively drift apart from the beat of the other tracks, so latency correction will never synchronize it correctly along its entire length. 
</p><p><b>To fix speed drift, pitch and quality problems, try the following tips.</b>   
</p>
<ul><li> Use the same device for playback and recording. </li>
<li> Ensure your sound device has <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Updating_Sound_Device_Drivers">up-to-date drivers</a> specifically intended for your particular computer model and operating system, as provided by the motherboard or sound device manufacturer. Ensure USB or FireWire devices have the manufacturer's latest firmware.</li>
<li> If you hear crackling while playing and recording at the same time, try increasing the "Buffer length" setting in <a href="devices_preferences.html#Latency" title="Devices Preferences">Devices Preferences</a>. On Mac you may need to <i>reduce</i> the Audio to buffer setting, even if only recording.  </li>
<li> If crackling occurs while playing the tracks together, check if the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#playback" title="Meter Toolbar">Playback Meter's</a> red <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i> warning is showing, which would indicate the combined volume of the tracks is too loud. To fix the clipping, use the <a href="audio_tracks.html#gain" title="Audio Tracks">gain sliders</a> on one or more tracks to reduce the overall level. </li>
<li> Make sure the rate of the pre-existing tracks (as stated above the mute/solo buttons) is the same as the project rate. Select the tracks and click <span class="menu">Tracks &gt; <a href="tracks_menu.html#resample" title="Tracks Menu">Resample...</a></span> to resample the track to the project rate. </li>
<li> Set the <a href="selection_toolbar.html" title="Selection Toolbar">Project Rate</a> bottom left of the Audacity screen to 44,100 Hz <i>(or if your audio interface only uses a particular rate such as 48,000 Hz, set the project rate to that)</i>. Look at <span class="menu">Help &gt; <a href="help_menu_diagnostics.html#audio_device_info" title="Help Menu: Diagnostics">Audio Device Info...</a></span> to see the rates the device claims to support.  </li>
<li> If you are recording with a USB or FireWire interface, sample rates and number of recording channels <b>must</b> be the same everywhere. Match the Audacity project rate and the number of recording channels set in the Audacity preferences with those specified:  
<ul><li> in the Windows <a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">Windows Sound controls</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X">Apple Audio MIDI Setup</a></li>
<li> in any software control panel the device has </li>
<li> on any hardware control the device has.</li></ul></li>
<li> Ensure your USB device is connected to a spare USB port of the computer and not to a USB hub. </li>
<li> If you are on Windows:
<ul><li>Set the Audacity project rate to the same rate as the <b>Default Format</b> for your sound device. To view the "Default Format", go to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_OS#cp">Windows Control Panel</a>, select the Playback" and "Recording" tabs in turn, right-click over a device entry &gt; Properties, and look in the "Advanced" tab. If the playback and recording format rates are different, make them the same. Also make sure the number of recording channels set in the Audacity Preferences matches with that specified in Default Format. </li>
<li>If that does not help, select <b>Windows DirectSound</b> as the "host" in <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> in Audacity. On the "Advanced" tab of "Sound" in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_OS#cp">Windows Control Panel</a>, ensure both boxes for <b>Exclusive Mode</b> are checked. For this to work, the Audacity project rate <b>must</b> be a rate supported by your device and all other sample rate settings <b>must</b> be at that same rate.    </li></ul></li>
<li> If you suspect recording dropouts as the cause of loss of synchronization, read our tips about <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Managing_Computer_Resources_and_Drivers">managing computer resources</a>.</li></ul>

<p>The USB connection on electronic keyboards, pianos, drum machines or other electronic instruments is often a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> connection containing instructions with which MIDI software like Finale or Cubase can create notes of specific pitch and duration. Audacity cannot yet accept MIDI input, so it can only record an audio signal (the actual sound that the keyboard produces).
</p><p>If your keyboard manual says you can send audio over USB but there is a problem, try tightening or replacing the USB cable, ensure it is connected directly to a spare USB port on the computer, then restart Audacity or the computer. 
</p><p>In the absence of a USB audio output:
</p>
<ul><li> connect from the <b>AUX</b> or <b>Line</b> outputs of the keyboard to the line-in (blue) port of the computer </li>
<li> if there is no AUX or Line output, connect from the <b>headphones out</b> of the keyboard to computer line-in</li>
<li> record using a <b>high quality microphone</b> - see <a href="connecting_a_microphone.html" title="Connecting a Microphone">Connecting a Microphone</a></li>
<li> some keyboards may have a function to record direct to a USB flash or hard drive - choose WAV format if available if you want to edit the recordings in Audacity.</li></ul>
<div class="note">Connecting from headphones out will disconnect the keyboard speakers. In this case you can use an adaptor that doubles the headphones out, or enable <span class="menu">Transport &gt; Transport Options &gt; <a href="transport_menu_transport_options.html#software_playthrough_onoff" title="Transport Menu: Transport Options">Software Playthrough (on/off)</a></span> in Audacity to listen as you record. See <a href="connecting_an_instrument.html" title="Connecting an Instrument">Connecting an Instrument</a> for details and images of suitable audio connectors.</div> 
<p>Many new laptop computers these days only come with a mono "microphone" (pink) input which will distort if you connect a keyboard to it. Occasionally the pink input can be switched to stereo line level in the audio control panel or may be "compatible" with stereo line level (this may not be of highest quality). Check your computer manual or experiment connecting from the keyboard headphones out with the volume <b>turned well down</b>. However in most cases it is preferable to purchase a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Sound_Devices_and_Interfaces#USB_Interfaces">USB interface with line level input</a> instead.

<p>If you hear crackles, pops, or distortion when the recording is loud, or if the waveform is clearly touching the top and bottom edges of the track, you probably have <a href="audacity_waveform.html#clip" title="Audacity Waveform">clipping</a>, which means that the signal has exceeded the maximum allowed level.  
</p><p>Try lowering the recording level using the Audacity <a href="mixer_toolbar.html" title="Mixer Toolbar">Mixer Toolbar</a> or the slider in the operating system. You can also check to see if you can lower the volume on the input source itself (such as the <b>tape deck</b>,  <b>record player</b> or <b>microphone</b>). Many sound cards and USB turntables or USB tape decks have an independent volume control for the playback signal level.  See <a href="recording_with_usb_turntables.html" title="Recording with USB turntables">Recording with USB turntables or USB cassette decks</a> for more help with USB turntables or tape decks.    
</p><p>When recording, try to aim for a maximum peak of around \xe2\x80\x936 <i><b><a href="glossary.html#decibel" title="Glossary">dB</a></b></i> in the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter</a> so as to prevent the meter's <a href="meter_toolbar.html#annotated" title="Meter Toolbar">red clipping warning</a> coming on.

<p><b>USB turntables and tape decks</b>
</p><p>Reports of recordings from USB turntables freezing or having dropouts are not that uncommon. Generally they are <b>not</b> caused by Audacity, but by poor quality equipment and cables, or lack of sufficient USB bandwidth.   
</p>
<ul><li> Check the Project Rate bottom left of the Audacity screen is set to either 44,100 or 48,000 Hz - setting a very high rate might overload the USB bandwidth and cause transmission problems </li></ul>
<ul><li> Check the USB cable for tightness at both ends and try using a different cable instead</li></ul>
<ul><li> Always use a spare USB port, not a hub</li></ul>
<ul><li> Limit USB bandwidth whilst recording by using other USB devices sparingly for example simply disconnecting from the Internet may help if you use a USB modem for Internet access. </li></ul>
<ul><li> Check for any system warnings (for example in Device Manager in Windows) about the Universal Serial Bus Controllers. </li></ul>
<ul><li> There have been isolated reports that recordings freeze up if they are attempted whilst the unit's RCA cables are connected to an external input such as a home stereo, although concurrent recording and playing through external equipment is implied as being possible.  </li></ul>
<p>Generally, if you find you can record into Audacity without interruption from another source such as a microphone plugged into your computer's microphone port, this implicates the turntable or USB cable. To check if other sources record satisfactorily, go to <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> and change the <a href="device_toolbar.html#record" title="Device Toolbar">Recording Device</a> to your inbuilt sound. 
</p><p>If recordings from sources other than the turntable are also freezing or have dropouts, there could be problems with insufficient computer resources, see above.

<p>If the red recording cursor moves across the screen but no waveform is drawn behind it (only a flat line), you need to start from the beginning and set up your recording device and input source properly. 
</p><p><b>Step 1: input device</b>
</p><p>Select the <b>Recording Device</b> you are using (such as microphone or line-in) in the dropdown selector of the Audacity <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a>. <i>The dropdown selector you need is the one with the microphone icon.</i>
</p><p>If you are plugging a microphone or line-in input directly into the jacks on the computer, or recording computer playback such as Internet radio, choose the name of the built-in sound device or sound card.
</p>
<div class="note"><b>By default, Windows only enables the microphone input.</b> You must exit Audacity, then go to "Sound" in the Windows Control Panel to show and enable other inputs before you can record from them. Instructions can be found on this page: <a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls</a>.</div>        
<p>If you are connecting an external device to the computer, such as a USB sound card, USB microphone or USB turntable, choose "USB Audio Codec" or similar.
</p>
<div id="detect"></div>
<div class="note"><b>Detecting USB and FireWire devices:</b><br />If Audacity does not recognize the device, try exiting Audacity and relaunching it, or in current Audacity choose <span class="menu">Transport &gt; <a href="transport_menu.html#rescan_audio_devices" title="Transport Menu">Rescan Audio Devices</a></span>. If that does not help, use the following steps.
<ol><li> Exit Audacity.</li>
<li> Unplug all other USB devices, then switch off and unplug the recording device at the USB connection and at the mains <i>(on Windows, use the "Safely Remove Hardware" icon in the System Tray).</i></li>
<li> Plug the recording device into a spare USB port (not a USB hub), and switch it on.</li>
<li> Wait a few minutes then completely shut down the computer and restart it. On <b>Windows 8 or later</b> you should <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://superuser.com/questions/656459/disabling-hybrid-boot-in-windows-8?answertab=votes#tab-top">disable hybrid boot</a> (or Shift-click on the "Shut down" choice, or on Windows 8.1 only, use Windows key and X, then "Shut down") to ensure the USB drivers are fully re-initialized. </li>
<li> When the computer has finished rebooting, launch Audacity.</li>
<li> If Audacity still does not recognize the device, try another USB cable, or a different empty USB port, then repeat steps 1 to 5. </li></ol>
<p><b>Setting sample rates for USB or FireWire interfaces:</b></p><p>It is important to set the same sample rate in the project rate bottom left of the Audacity window, in the operating system mixer, in any settings in the device's control panel and on any controls on the device itself.</p></div>
<p><b>Step 2: playback device</b>
</p><p>Also in the dropdown selector of the Audacity <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> select the playback device you are using, usually this will be your computer's on-board sound card. <i>The dropdown selector you need this time is the one with the loudspeaker icon.</i>
</p><p><b>Step 3: channels</b>
</p><p>In the Audacity <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a> set the <b>Recording Channels</b> to <b>1 (mono)</b> or <b>2 (stereo)</b> as required.
</p><p><b>Step 4: recording signal level</b>
</p><p>In the <a href="mixer_toolbar.html" title="Mixer Toolbar">Mixer Toolbar</a>, adjust the <b>recording level</b> using the recording slider <i>(the one that has the "microphone" symbol)</i> in conjunction with the <a href="meter_toolbar.html#recording" title="Meter Toolbar">Recording Meter</a> level to set the correct recording level before starting to record for real. 
</p><p>If the Audacity recording slider does not control the recording level of the device, use the slider in the operating system instead. This is usually accessed by a loudspeaker icon near the system clock.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_do_I_get_a_periodic_noise_every_6_-_12_seconds_when_recording.3F">Why do I get a periodic noise every 6 - 12 seconds when recording?</span></h2>
<p>Audacity writes to disk roughly every 6 or 12 seconds, depending on your preferences settings. If you hear a funny noise in the background that is relatively consistent every 6 - 12 seconds, it means that your sound card is picking up the noise from your hard drive. 
</p><p>See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Improving_recording_quality">Improving recording quality</a> in the Audacity Wiki, because you will probably need to find a better driver or upgrade your hardware. 
</p><p>Also consider however if a security application could be scanning Audacity's disk writes. If so, the noise could come from increased CPU activity as a result of the scan. You should not turn off security applications unless you are disconnected from the Internet, but you may be able to add an exception to the application so that it does not scan Audacity or its <a href="directories_preferences.html" title="Directories Preferences">temporary folder</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_prevent_a_half-volume_mono_recording.3F">How can I prevent a half-volume mono recording?</span></h2>
<p>This can occur when connecting to one channel only of a device that has separate left and right channel inputs. Recording in mono will often result in a half-volume track that cannot be made louder without adding distortion. If this happens:

<div id="unbalanced"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_prevent_unbalanced_or_poorly_separated_stereo_recording.3F">How can I prevent unbalanced or poorly separated stereo recording?</span></h2>
<p>Ensure Audacity is set to <a href="faq_recording_how_to_s.html#rinstereo" title="FAQ:Recording - How To's">record in stereo</a> using <a href="device_toolbar.html" title="Device Toolbar">Device Toolbar</a>. Your recorded track will then say "Stereo" in its <a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Track Control Panel</a> and two channels, left above right, will be displayed when you press the <b>Record</b> <img alt="image of record button" src="../m/images/e/e8/record.png" title="image of record button" width="16" height="16" /> button. 
</p><p>Also ensure that the Recording Device is set in the system mixer to record in stereo and that the left and right channels are balanced.  
</p>
<ul><li> On <b>Windows</b>, access the recording section of <span class="menu"><a href="windows_accessing_the_windows_sound_controls.html" title="Windows: accessing the Windows Sound controls">Sound</a></span>. This is  usually accessed by right-clicking over the speaker icon by the system clock. On Windows, devices often default to mono, which will lead to identical left and right channels in Audacity.</li>
<li> On <b>Mac</b> go to  <span class="menu">Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Audio-MIDI Setup: Audio Devices</span>. </li></ul>
<p>Ensure that any balance controls on your mixer, amplifier or record player/cassette deck are centrally placed. 
</p><p>For non-USB recordings, make sure you are using a clean, tightly connected <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Connecting_your_Equipment#trs">stereo plug</a>. Ensure that the computer port you are connecting to is stereo. Most microphone ports are mono. A laptop that only has a single input will usually offer only low quality, poorly separated stereo when using a stereo plug. You can buy modestly priced, decent quality USB interfaces with line level stereo input if needs be. 
</p>
<div class="note">If your source is mono but Audacity is set to record in stereo, it is often best to change Audacity to record in mono using Device Toolbar. Otherwise, you may have a silent right channel (or sometimes two identical channels, according to the sound device). </div>

<div id="rebalance"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_correct_an_unbalanced_stereo_recording.3F">How can I correct an unbalanced stereo recording?</span></h2>
<p>If you cannot <a href="#unbalanced">prevent the imbalance</a> at the input stage, you can correct a stereo imbalance using the <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize</a> effect after the recording has been made.
</p>
<ol><li>In Audacity, click the <a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Track Control Panel</a> where it says "Stereo" to select all the audio of the track, then click <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize...</a></span>. </li>
<li>In the dialog box, put a check mark in <span class="button"><img alt="checked checkbox" src="../m/images/8/85/checkboxchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" />&#160;Normalize maximum amplitude to:</span> and type the <i><b><a href="glossary.html#amplitude" title="Glossary">amplitude</a></b></i> level you require <i>(-6 dB is a good choice if you have further editing to do)</i>.  </li>
<li>Put a check mark in <span class="button"><img alt="checked checkbox" src="../m/images/8/85/checkboxchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" />&#160;Normalize stereo channels independently</span>. Then press the <span class="button">OK</span> button.</li></ol>
<p>This will adjust the volume of each channel independently so that both have the same maximum (peak) level (in our example, the peak is 6 dB less than the distortion level).
</p><p><b>Custom balancing</b>
</p><p>Sometimes the track may still <i>sound</i> louder in one channel than the other, even after normalizing. This usually happens because of the content. For example, one channel may have more deep bass sounds which are naturally louder, or one channel may be mostly quiet but have one loud peak. 
</p><p>To adjust each channel to its own peak volume, click the downward-pointing arrow in the <a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Track Control Panel</a> to open the <a href="audio_track_dropdown_menu.html" title="Audio Track Dropdown Menu">Audio Track Dropdown Menu</a> then choose "Split Stereo Track". Click on "Left" in the Track Control Panel of the upper track to select it, then use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="amplify.html" title="Amplify">Amplify...</a></span> and choose your required <a href="amplify.html" title="Amplify">New Peak Amplitude</a>. Click OK, then amplify the right channel to your chosen New Peak Amplitude. To rejoin the channels into one track, use the Track Dropdown Menu again and choose "Make Stereo Track". 
</p><p>Custom rebalancing can also be carried out during playback while the track is split into two channels, using the Gain Slider <a href="https://alphamanual.audacityteam.org/man/File:TrackGain.png" class="image" title="Track Gain Slider"><img alt="Track Gain Slider" src="../m/images/a/ae/trackgain.png" width="97" height="25" /></a> on each channel. This method can lead to distortion, so check that the  <a href="meter_toolbar.html#playback" title="Meter Toolbar">Playback Meter</a> does not show the red <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i> indicator. As soon as you are happy that the balance, use <span class="menu">Tracks &gt; Mix &gt; <a href="tracks_menu_mix.html#mix_and_render" title="Tracks Menu: Mix">Mix and Render</a></span> to render the gain changes and rejoin the stereo track.  
</p><p>If the sound remains unbalanced due to a few loud peaks, you could instead use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="compressor.html" title="Compressor">Compressor...</a></span> on the unsplit stereo track to reduce the difference between loud and soft.

<div id="offset"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_the_recorded_waveform_not_centered_on_the_horizontal_line_at_0.0.3F">Why is the recorded waveform not centered on the horizontal line at 0.0?</span></h2>
<p><b>Cause and impact</b>
</p><p>This off-setting of a signal from zero is known as <a href="dc_offset.html" title="DC offset">DC offset</a>. A signal with DC offset would appear in the Audacity default <a href="audacity_waveform.html" title="Audacity Waveform">Waveform</a> view as not centered on the 0.0 horizontal line. 
</p><p>A sound that has DC offset will not be at its loudest possible volume when normalized or amplified (because the offset consumes <i><b><a href="glossary.html#headroom" title="Glossary">headroom</a></b></i>). This problem can possibly extend to the mix as a whole, because a sound with DC offset and a sound without DC offset will have DC offset when mixed.
</p><p>DC offset can cause clicks at the start and end of the audio or audible distortion after running effects.  
DC offset can also cause inaudible low level distortion which becomes audible after applying a <i><b><a href="glossary.html#filter" title="Glossary">filter</a></b></i> or if the audio is <a href="exporting_audio.html" title="Exporting Audio">exported</a> to a <b><i><a href="glossary.html#compressed_format" title="Glossary">compressed audio format</a>. </i></b>
</p><p><b>Removal</b>
</p><p>You can use <span class="menu">Effect &gt; <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize...</a></span> to remove DC offset. Put a check mark in the <span class="button"><img alt="checked checkbox" src="../m/images/8/85/checkboxchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" />&#160;Remove any DC offset...</span> box but leave the <span class="button"><img alt="unchecked checkbox" src="../m/images/a/a8/checkboxnotchecked.png" width="13" height="13" style="vertical-align: text-top" />&#160;Normalize maximum amplitude..</span> box unchecked and then press the <span class="button">OK</span> button.
</p><p><b>Hardware upgrade</b>
</p><p>The usual cause of DC offset is a faulty or inadequate audio interface.  It may be worthwhile considering upgrading your computer's built-in sound card or purchasing an external audio interface. However recent built-in sound cards on Windows machines sometimes have a <a href="dc_offset.html#cancel" title="DC offset">DC offset cancellation</a> control which can be set for each input.

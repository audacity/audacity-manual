<div class="intro">
The <i><b>Export Audio</b></i> dialog (for export of a single audio file from the whole project)  is accessed from <span class="menu">File &gt; Export &gt; <a href="file_menu_export.html#exportaudio" title="File Menu: Export">Export Audio...</a></span>. When you use <span class="menu">File &gt; Export &gt; <a href="file_menu_export.html#exportselectedaudio" title="File Menu: Export">Export Selected Audio...</a></span> to export a single audio file from a <a href="audacity_selection.html" title="Audacity Selection">selection</a>, the <i><b>Export Selected Audio</b></i> dialog appears. Both these dialogs are identical <i>(apart from the dialog title)</i> and let you specify folder location, file name, format and encoding options for your exported file.<p>You can use <span class="menu">File &gt; Export &gt; <a href="export_multiple.html" title="Export Multiple">Export Multiple...</a></span> to export multiple audio files (based on <a href="label_tracks.html" title="Label Tracks">labels</a> or multiple <a href="audio_tracks.html" title="Audio Tracks">audio tracks</a>) in one process.</p>
<div class="note">Please be aware that when using <b>Export</b> or <b>Export Multiple</b> Audacity will only export tracks that are not grayed-out by use of the <span class="button"><a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Mute</a></span> or <span class="button"><a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Solo</a></span> buttons in the tracks' <a href="audio_tracks.html#panel" title="Audio Tracks">Track Control Panels</a>. So what you hear by previewing with playback prior to export is what you will get in the Exported audio file.
<ul><li>When using <b>Export Selected Audio</b>, however, Audacity will Export the selection from <i><b>all</b></i> selected tracks even if some if those tracks are grayed-out and inaudible on playback.</div> </div></li></ul>

<p>In summary, there are five steps to follow when exporting.  
</p>
<ul><li>Choose the folder to export to in <b>Save in:</b> then type the file name you want.</li>
<li>Select the type of audio file to export to. </li>
<li>Set the <a href="#options">Format Options</a> <i>(if those are available for your selected format)</i> if you want to change the size, quality or other encoding choices for that selected file format.</li>
<li>Press <span class="button">Save</span>.</li>
<li>The <a href="metadata_editor.html" title="Metadata Editor">Metadata Editor</a> dialog will then appear (unless you have disabled it for the export step in the <a href="import_export_preferences.html#export" title="Import - Export Preferences">Import/Export Preferences</a>). Edit Metadata lets you enter embedded information in the file such as artist, year or genre. Either leave the metadata blank or complete the fields you require, then press <span class="button">OK</span> (<i><b>not</b></i> "Save...").</li></ul>
<div id="name"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="File_name">File name</span></h3>
Type the required file name. The correct file <i><b><a href="glossary.html#extension" title="Glossary">extension</a></b></i> - preceded by a period (dot) - will be added automatically to the end of the file name, according to the format selected in the "Save as type" list (see below). For example, typing "08 Voodoo Chile" (without quotes) will produce a file "08 Voodoo Chile.wav". For M4A and WMA formats (for which the optional <a href="faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#installffmpeg" title="FAQ:Installation and Plug-Ins">FFmpeg library</a> is required), you can add alternative extensions as specified in "FFmpeg formats" below.<p>Any other extensions can be added after a file name as required, but Audacity will display a warning that this is not the normal extension for this file type, and that some applications might not play files with non-standard extensions.</p>

<p>You can use <b>Export Audio</b> or <b>Export Selected Audio</b> to export multiple tracks as a mono or stereo <a href="mixing.html" title="Mixing">mixdown</a>, or as a multi-channel audio file by enabling <a href="advanced_mixing_options.html" title="Advanced Mixing Options">Advanced Mixing Options</a>.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Export_progress_dialog">Export progress dialog</span></h2>
<p>Once you have clicked the <span class="button">Save</span> button in the export dialog and <span class="button">OK</span> in Edit Metadata, Audacity will display a dialog displaying progress of writing the exported file:

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stop_and_Cancel">Stop and Cancel</span></h3>
<p>Clicking the:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Leading_black_space_in_exported_track.28s.29_or_project">Leading black space in exported track(s) or project</span></h2>
<p>When exporting audio any leading blank space offset in the tracks or project to be exported is treated as silence and appropriate leading silence will pad the exported audio.  
</p><p>There is an option in <a href="import_export_preferences.html#export" title="Import - Export Preferences">Import/Export Preferences</a> where you can turn this off and have leading blank space ignored on Export.
</p>
<ul><li>A use case for turning this off is track-based multiple export where you have "songs" lined up one after the other on different tracks - and in this case you probably do not want the offsets exported as long silences at the start of "songs".</li></ul>

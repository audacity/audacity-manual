The <i><b>Export Audio</b></i> dialog (for export of a single audio file from the whole project)  is accessed from <span class="menu">File &gt; Export &gt; <a href="file_menu_export.html#exportaudio" title="File Menu: Export">Export Audio...</a></span>. When you use <span class="menu">File &gt; Export &gt; <a href="file_menu_export.html#exportselectedaudio" title="File Menu: Export">Export Selected Audio...</a></span> to export a single audio file from a <a href="audacity_selection.html" title="Audacity Selection">selection</a>, the <i><b>Export Selected Audio</b></i> dialog appears. Both these dialogs are identical and let you specify folder location, file name, format and encoding options for your exported file.<p>You can use <span class="menu">File &gt; Export &gt; <a href="export_multiple.html" title="Export Multiple">Export Multiple...</a></span> to export multiple audio files (based on <a href="label_tracks.html" title="Label Tracks">labels</a> or multiple <a href="audio_tracks.html" title="Audio Tracks">audio tracks</a>) in one process.</p> </div>

For <b>Export Selected Audio</b> empty space between clips in the selection will be rendered as silence in the export.

<td align="left" valign="top">The simple workaround if you want to preserve the offset as silence in the exported file for <b>Export Audio</b> is to insert a short section of silence right at the beginning of tracks that you require the offset for.  When the Export is made Audacity will render the empty space between this silence and the audio as silence.

<p>In summary, there are five steps to follow when exporting.  
</p>
<ul><li>Choose the folder to export to in <b>Save in:</b> then type the file name you want.</li>
<li>Select the type of audio file to export to. </li>
<li>Set the <a href="#options">Format Options</a> <i>(if those are available for your selected format)</i> if you want to change the size, quality or other encoding choices for that selected file format.</li>
<li>Press <span class="button">Save</span>.</li>
<li>The <a href="metadata_editor.html" title="Metadata Editor">Metadata Editor</a> dialog will then appear (unless you have disabled it for the export step in the <a href="import_export_preferences.html#export" title="Import - Export Preferences">Import/Export Preferences</a>). Edit Metadata lets you enter embedded information in the file such as artist, year or genre. Either leave the metadata blank or complete the fields you require, then press <span class="button">OK</span> (<i><b>not</b></i> "Save...").</li></ul>
<div id="name"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="File_name">File name</span></h3>
Type the required file name. The correct file <i><b><a href="glossary.html#extension" title="Glossary">extension</a></b></i> - preceded by a period (dot) - will be added automatically to the end of the file name, according to the format selected in the "Save as type" list (see below). For example, typing "08 Voodoo Chile" (without quotes) will produce a file "08 Voodoo Chile.wav". For M4A and WMA formats (for which the optional <a href="faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#installffmpeg" title="FAQ:Installation and Plug-Ins">FFmpeg library</a> is required), you can add alternative extensions as specified in "FFmpeg formats" below.<p>Any other extensions can be added after a file name as required, but Audacity will display a warning that this is not the normal extension for this file type, and that some applications might not play files with non-standard extensions.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Nyquist_plug-ins_included_in_Audacity">Nyquist plug-ins included in Audacity</span></h2>
<p>The following sample Nyquist plug-ins are included in released builds of Audacity:
</p>
<div id="adjustable_fade"></div>
<div id="adjustable"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Adjustable_Fade..."><a href="adjustable_fade.html" title="Adjustable Fade">Adjustable Fade...</a></span></h3>
<p>Launches a dialog box where you can choose the shape of the fade in or fade out to be applied. You can also create fades to and from other than silence or full volume. An example of this might be a fade in from 20% of the original volume to 80% of the original volume.  
</p>
<div id="clip_fix"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Clip_Fix..."><a href="clip_fix.html" title="Clip Fix">Clip Fix...</a></span></h3>
<p>Attempts to reconstruct clipped regions by interpolating the lost signal.
</p>
<div id="crossfade_clips"></div>
<div id="xfade"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crossfade_Clips"><a href="crossfade_clips.html" title="Crossfade Clips">Crossfade Clips</a></span></h3>
<p>Applies a simple crossfade to a selected pair of clips in a single audio track.
</p>
<div id="crossfade_tracks"></div>
<div id="crossfade"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Crossfade_Tracks"><a href="crossfade_tracks.html" title="Crossfade Tracks">Crossfade Tracks</a></span></h3>
<p>Applies a crossfade to a selected region of a pair of tracks.
</p>
<div id="delay"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Delay..."><a href="delay.html" title="Delay">Delay...</a></span></h3>
<p>A configurable delay effect with variable delay time and pitch shifting of the delays.
</p>
<div id="high_pass_filter"></div>
<div id="high-pass_filter"></div>
<div id="filters"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="High-Pass_Filter..."><a href="high_pass_filter.html" title="High-Pass Filter">High-Pass Filter...</a></span></h3>
<p>Passes frequencies above its cutoff frequency and attenuates frequencies below its cutoff frequency; this can be used to reduce low frequency noise.
</p>
<div id="limiter"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limiter..."><a href="limiter.html" title="Limiter">Limiter...</a></span></h3>
<p>Limiter passes signals below a specified input level unaffected or gently reduced, while preventing the peaks of stronger signals from exceeding this threshold. Limiting is a type of dynamic range compression. Mastering engineers often use limiting combined with make-up gain to increase the perceived loudness of an audio recording during the audio mastering process.
</p>
<div id="low_pass_filter"></div>
<div id="low-pass_filter"></div>
<div id="low_pass"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Low-Pass_Filter..."><a href="low_pass_filter.html" title="Low-Pass Filter">Low-Pass Filter...</a></span></h3>
<p>Passes frequencies below its cutoff frequency and attenuates frequencies above its cutoff frequency; this can be used to reduce high pitched noise. 
</p>
<div id="notch_filter"></div>
<div id="notch"></div>  
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Notch_Filter..."><a href="notch_filter.html" title="Notch Filter">Notch Filter...</a></span></h3>
<p>Greatly attenuate ("notch out") a narrow frequency band. This is a good way to reduce mains hum or a whistle confined to a specific frequency with minimal damage to the remainder of the audio.  
</p>
<div id="nyquist_prompt"></div>
<div id="Nyquist"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nyquist_Prompt..."><a href="nyquist_prompt.html" title="Nyquist Prompt">Nyquist Prompt...</a></span></h3>
<p>Launches a dialog where you can enter Nyquist commands. Nyquist is a applicationming language for producing and processing audio. For more information see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Nyquist_Plug-ins_Reference">Nyquist Plug-ins Reference</a>.

<div id="spectral_multi"></div>

<div class="note"><i><b>Spectral edit multi tool</b></i> (and <i><b>Spectral edit parametric EQ</b></i> and <i><b>Spectral edit shelves</b></i> described immediately following) are intended for working on a combined frequency and time selection made when using <a href="audio_track_dropdown_menu.html#spgram" title="Audio Track Dropdown Menu">Spectrogram</a> view.</div>
<p>If a fully defined <a href="spectral_selection.html" title="Spectral Selection">spectral selection</a> has been made, choosing <i>Spectral edit multi-tool</i> applies the appropriate filter for the selection. See <a href="spectral_selection.html#multi" title="Spectral Selection">Spectral edit multi tool</a> for more information.
</p>
<div id="spectral_edit_parametric_eq"></div>
<div id="spectral_eq"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spectral_edit_parametric_EQ..."><a href="spectral_edit_parametric_eq.html" title="Spectral edit parametric EQ">Spectral edit parametric EQ...</a></span></h3>
<p>If a fully defined <a href="spectral_selection.html" title="Spectral Selection">spectral selection</a> has been made, the effect applies a band cut or band boost according to the value you enter in the "Gain (dB)" control. See <a href="spectral_edit_parametric_eq.html" title="Spectral edit parametric EQ">Spectral edit parametric EQ</a> for more information.
</p>
<div id="spectral_edit_shelves"></div>
<div id="spectral_shelves"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spectral_edit_shelves..."><a href="spectral_edit_shelves.html" title="Spectral edit shelves">Spectral edit shelves...</a></span></h3>
<p>If a fully defined <a href="spectral_selection.html" title="Spectral Selection">spectral selection</a> has been made, the effect applies a low shelf filter, high shelf filter or combined low and high shelf filter according to the value you enter in the "Gain (dB)" control. See <a href="spectral_edit_shelves.html" title="Spectral edit shelves">Spectral edit shelves</a> for more information.
</p>
<div id="studio_fade_out"></div>
<div id="studio_fadeout"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Studio_Fade_Out"><a href="fades.html#studio_fadeout" title="Fades">Studio Fade Out</a></span></h3>
<p>Produces a smooth and musical sounding fade out, by applying a sinusoidal fade with a progressive low-pass filter from full spectrum at the start of the selection to 100 Hz at the end.
</p>
<div id="tremolo"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tremolo..."><a href="tremolo.html" title="Tremolo">Tremolo...</a></span></h3>
<p>Modulates the volume of the selection at the depth and rate selected in the dialog. The same as the tremolo effect familiar to guitar and keyboard players.
</p>
<div id="vocal_reduction_and_isolation"></div>
<div id="vrandi"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocal_Reduction_and_Isolation..."><a href="vocal_reduction_and_isolation.html" title="Vocal Reduction and Isolation">Vocal Reduction and Isolation...</a></span></h3>
<p>Attempts to remove or isolate center-panned audio from a stereo track. Vocals are often <i>(but not always)</i> recorded in this way. The <i>classic method</i> achieves this by subtracting one channel from the other, but the result will be (dual) mono <i>(this method can be found under the Actions menu in this effect as "Remove Center Classic (Mono)" and is a quick way to remove the center if only mono is needed)</i>. All other "Remove" options in this effect preserve the stereo image
</p>
<div id="vocal_remover"></div>
<div id="vocal"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocal_Remover_.28for_center-panned_vocals.29..."><a href="vocal_remover.html" title="Vocal Remover">Vocal Remover (for center-panned vocals)...</a></span></h3>
<p>Attempts to remove center-panned audio from a stereo track. Vocals are often <i>(but not always)</i> recorded in this way. Vocals (or other audio) can only be removed with this plug-in when panned to center, in other words sounding equally loud in both left and right channels. Help text is available from within the effect's dialog box.  This is a "Legacy effect": the same result can be achieved by using the <i>Remove Center Classic (Mono)</i> option in  <a href="vocal_reduction_and_isolation.html" title="Vocal Reduction and Isolation">Vocal Reduction and Isolation</a>.
</p>
<div id="vocoder"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vocoder..."><a href="vocoder.html" title="Vocoder">Vocoder...</a></span></h3>
<p>Vocoder synthesizes a modulator (usually a voice) in the left channel of a stereo track with a carrier wave in the right channel to produce a modified version of the left channel. Vocoding a normal voice with white noise as provided in the effect will produce a robot-like voice for special effects. Other carriers can be used for subtly different voices. Vocoder can only be applied to unsplit stereo tracks.

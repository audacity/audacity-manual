<div class="intro"><i><b>Vocal Reduction and Isolation</b></i> attempts to  remove or isolate center-panned audio from a stereo track. Vocals are sometimes (but not always) recorded in this way. The simplest and quickest removal method  subtracts one channel from the other, but the result will be (dual) mono. This method is available at "Remove Center Classic: (Mono)" under <a href="#action">Action</a>. All other "Remove" options in this effect preserve the stereo image. 
<p>The <b>Isolate</b> options all return (dual) mono output. The narrowness of the center slice can be adjusted with the "Strength" slider. Center isolation is not possible using the classic subtraction method.
</p><p>The <b>Analyze</b> option displays the amount of correlation between the stereo channels and the degree of likelihood that center removal or isolation will work effectively.

</p>
<div id="strength"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Strength">Strength</span></h2>
<p>The shape of the center is not a thin band but rather like a tent  with a pole in the middle. This means that there will always audio from other pan positions included. The <b>Strength</b> slider modifies the shape of the center. Higher values increase the degree of reduction or isolation. Zero is off (no reduction or isolation). This slider has no effect with the "Remove Center Classic: (Mono)" choice. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Remove">Remove</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>Less than 1.0:</b> Produces a notch with a <i><b>V</b></i> shape like a ship's keel, but also with a sharp point. Use this setting to preserve some amount of the center.</li>
<li><b>1.0 - the default:</b> Produces a notch with a <i><b>V</b></i> shape. The power distribution is preserved. This is the ideal setting for most cases.</li>
<li><b>Greater than 1.0:</b>  Produces a notch with a <i><b>U</b></i> shape. This removes some audio adjacent to the center, as well as the center.  Note that this will not remove stereo reverberation since it is distributed over the entire pan width.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Isolate">Isolate</span></h3>
<ul><li><b>Less than 1.0:</b> Produces a peak like a <i><b>U</b></i> shape upside down, similar to an arch. Only extreme left and right are eliminated.</li>
<li><b>1.0 - the default:</b> Produces a peak like a <i><b>V</b></i> shape upside down. The power distribution is preserved.  You might want a higher value when a lot of side audio leaks in. This is also the recommended setting when working with two tracks (options with <b>...and Invert</b>).</li>
<li><b>Greater than 1.0:</b> Produces a peak with an <i><b>A</b></i> shape like the Eiffel Tower (with a sharp point). This will attenuate most of the side energy but might produce artifacts or musical noise. <a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize">Normalize</a> the audio after using Isolate with a high strength setting.</li></ul>

<div id="lowcut"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Low_Cut_for_Vocals">Low Cut for Vocals</span></h2>
<p>All actions with <b>Vocals</b> in the name use this value. The frequencies below will  either not be removed or not be included in the isolated audio. It is useful to exclude bass and kick drum. The default value of 120 Hz is good for most lead vocals, or even low male voices. You can enter a higher value around 170 Hz for female voices and about 230 Hz for those of children.
</p>
<div class="note">This control only affects "<a href="#action">Actions</a>" that contain the word <b>Vocals</b> in their name.</div>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="High_Cut_for_Vocals">High Cut for Vocals</span></h2>
<p>All actions with <b>Vocals</b> in the name use this value. The frequencies above  will  either not be removed or not be included in the isolated audio. It is useful to exclude high sounds like bells, cymbals or Hi-hat. Note that human sounds like <b>S</b> or <b>Z</b> can also be very high in frequency - 5000 to 8000 Hz, so listen carefully to the preview.

<ul><li><span class="button">Manage</span> gives a dropdown menu enabling you to manage presets for the tool and to see some detail about the tool. For details see <a href="manage_presets.html" title="Manage presets">Manage presets</a></li>
<li><span class="button">Preview</span> plays a short preview of what the audio would sound like if the effect is applied with the current settings, without making actual changes to the audio.  The length of preview is determined by your setting in <span class="menu">Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; <a href="playback_preferences.html" title="Playback Preferences">Playback</a></span>, the default setting is 6 seconds.</li>
<li><span class="button">Debug</span> applies the effect to the selected audio with the current effect settings, but unlike <span class="button">OK</span> the effect runs in debug mode.

<ul><li>In addition to the normal plug-in behavior, a "debug window" opens to display error messages, normally the debug window will be empty</li></ul></li>
<li><span class="button">OK</span> applies the effect to the selected audio with the current effect settings and closes the dialog</li>
<li><span class="button">Cancel</span> aborts the effect and leaves the audio unchanged, closing the dialog</li>

<p><br />
</p>
<div id="analysis"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Interpreting_the_analysis_results">Interpreting the analysis results</span></h2>
<p>It is recommended to analyze the audio prior to actual processing of the effect. Analysis is very fast compared to the time needed for processing.
</p><p>The two important values are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Pan Position:</b> This gives the average pan position for the whole selected audio. The value of the track pan slider is not included in this calculation.</li>
<li><b>Correlation:</b> This is a measure for the similarity of the two channels. Values of +/-100 mean that the channels are exactly the same, even if one is inverted. A value of 0 means no relationship. It is fruitless to attempt removal or isolation in these cases. The ideal value is normally around +50. Values below 0 are rare and indicate that the stereo width is more than 100%. Inverting one channel makes the correlation positive.</li></ul>
<div class="note">Sometimes the lead vocals are not exactly in the middle. In this case, select a short portion of audio where only the voice is audible and no other instrument. Choose <b>Analyze</b>. 
<ol><li> The correlation should be fairly high (around 100) which would indicate that there is indeed only the voice.</li>
<li> Copy the value for the Pan Position. Double-click in the Pan slider to open the adjustment dialog then paste in the value with reversed sign (that is, put a minus sign in front of a positive value and a positive sign in front of a negative value). </li>
<li> Mix and render the track. The voice will now be exactly centered and you can remove or isolate it. </li>
<li> Do not forget to readjust the selection. </div></li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<div id="limitations"></div>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Limitations">Limitations</span></h2>
<ul><li>The input must be a true stereo track and not mere (dual) mono.</li>
<li>Stereo Reverberation will not be fully removed because it is independently distributed over the whole stereo image.</li>
<li>Naturally the plug-in does not know what kind of audio is in the center. All is removed or isolated equally, whether vocals, bass or solo instruments.</li>
<li>This effect is quite slow, except for the <i>"Remove Center Classic: (Mono)"</i> and <i>"Analyze"</i> actions.</li></ul>
<div style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:24px; margin-right:24px">

<ul><li>Removing random system noise from a two channel recording of a mono source. </li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>use <b>Isolate...</b> to remove random noise produced by the audio interface, the cables or the computer itself.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

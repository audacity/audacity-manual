<div class="intro">The <i><b>Timeline</b></i> displays a horizontal ruler above the tracks measuring time from zero (the start of the track).  Depending on <a href="zooming.html" title="Zooming">zooming</a> the ruler may span minutes of audio or give a "close up" view of a few seconds or fractions of a second. The Timeline is not merely an indicator of audio position but can also be used to effect <a href="#tqp">Quick-Play</a>.<p>A particularly powerful use of the Timeline is in the creation of seamless <a href="tutorial_looping.html#tqp" title="Tutorial - Looping">loops</a>.</p> </div>

<ul><li><img alt="QuickPlayRegionCursor.png" src="../m/images/c/c5/quickplayregioncursor.png" width="88" height="13" /> <b>Quick-Play region:</b> A region in the Timeline that plays immediately when dragged with the mouse, even if audio is already playing elsewhere. It is shown by thick left-pointing and right-pointing arrowheads connected by a line. By default, Quick-Play does not modify the position of the editing cursor or region in the <a href="audacity_waveform.html" title="Audacity Waveform">waveform</a> (this behavior may be changed in the <a href="#menu">Timeline context menu</a>). To start "Quick-Play" of a region (even if the track is already playing or paused from playing), hover over the Timeline until the mouse pointer changes to a hand, then drag in either direction and release. Playback will continue to the end of the Quick-Play region. 

<ul>

<li> If you just want to play from a particular point to the end of the project, click in the Timeline at the point from which you want playback to start or restart. The Quick-Play cursor is then shown only by a left-pointing arrowhead. Playback will continue to the end of the project. 

<li> To make the dragged Quick-Play region loop (play repeatedly until stopped), press and hold <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">Shift</span>, drag in the Timeline then release the drag. Loop play will be indicated by the Play button in <a href="transport_toolbar.html" title="Transport Toolbar">Transport Toolbar</a> changing to Loop Play <span title="Loop Play button"><img alt="Loop Play.png" src="../m/images/7/7e/loop_play.png" width="16" height="16" /></span>. 

<li> You can also play two seconds before the Quick-Play region and one second after it (as if that region had been deleted) just like <a href="playing_and_recording.html#play_cut" title="Playing and Recording">Play&#160;Cut&#160;Preview</a> of a region in the waveform. To preview cutting the Quick-Play region, press and hold <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">Ctrl</span> then drag and release in the Timeline. The duration that is played before and after the region can be changed in the Cut Preview section of <a href="playback_preferences.html" title="Playback Preferences">Playback Preferences</a>.

<li> As with standard playback, you can press <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">Space</span> or click the Stop button <img alt="Stop button" src="../m/images/f/f9/stop.png" title="Stop button" width="16" height="16" /> to stop Quick-Play before the end of the region or project is reached. </ul></ul>
<div id="play-region"></div>
<ul><li> <img alt="PlayRegionCursor.png" src="../m/images/8/86/playregioncursor.png" width="88" height="14" /> <b>Play Region Lock:</b> The position of the playback region (or the current position of the Quick-Play region) can be <i>locked</i> in the Timeline for use in all further standard playback. To do this, choose <span class="menu">Transport &gt; Play Region &gt; Lock</span> or right-click in the Timeline and choose <b>Lock Play Region</b> from the <a href="#menu">context menu</a>. 
<ul><li>When "Locked", the region displays in red in the Timeline. A locked region is <i>always</i> used for standard playback (including <a href="play_at_speed_toolbar.html" title="Play-at-Speed Toolbar">Play-at-Speed</a>) even if the editing cursor or region in the waveform is at a different position. </li>
<li>The position of the locked region cannot be expanded or contracted by dragging either red arrowhead. However, you can still click in the Timeline so the project Quick-Plays from there (or drag some other region in the Timeline so that region Quick-Plays), preserving the locked region. </li>
<li> You can also extend or contract Quick-Play with respect to the locked region without having to drag the entire region you want to Quick-Play. To do this, drag in either direction from the left-pointing red arrowhead of the locked region then release to play from the release point to the end of the locked region. Drag in either direction from the right-pointing red arrowhead then release to play from the start of the locked region to the release point. </li>
<li>To unlock the region so that all further playback respects the editing cursor or region in the waveform, choose <span class="menu">Transport &gt; Play Region &gt; Unlock</span>, or right-click in the Timeline and choose <b>Unlock Play Region</b> from the <a href="#menu">context menu</a>. </li>
<li>Play Region Lock or Unlock may be performed even when the track is playing or paused from playing.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pinned_Recordhead.2FPlayhead">Pinned Recordhead/Playhead</span></h2>
<p>You can change Audacity to play and record with a fixed head pinned to a position in the Timeline. In this mode the head remains static and the waveforms will move as the audio is played or recorded.
</p><p>This behavior is controlled by using the button at the left of the Timeline.  By default this shows as a green downwards-pointing triangle (like the playhead).  In this mode, the playhead or recordhead will move horizontally and the waveform will scroll when necessary, except that if <i>Update display when Recording/Playback head is unpinned</i> is unchecked in <a href="tracks_preferences.html" title="Tracks Preferences">Tracks Preferences</a> then scrolling will not occur. 
</p>
<dl><dd><span title="Unpinned Record/Playhead"><img alt="Unpinned head button.png" src="../m/images/5/56/unpinned_head_button.png" width="257" height="31" /></span></dd></dl>
<p>Clicking on the green triangle will cause the button icon to change to a drawing-pin.  This indicates that the playhead or recordhead is now pinned to the center of the Timeline and when playing or recording takes place the waveform will move continuously under the fixed head.
</p>
<dl><dd><span title="Pinned Record/Playhead"><img alt="Pinned head button.png" src="../m/images/f/f4/pinned_head_button.png" width="259" height="32" /></span></dd></dl>
<p>When pinned playback or recording is chosen, the playhead displays as a green drawing-pin (as shown in the image below) and the recording head displays as a red drawing-pin. 
</p>
<dl><dd><span title="Pinned head playback"><img alt="Pinned head playback annotated trackname.png" src="../m/images/5/50/pinned_head_playback_annotated_trackname.png" width="768" height="199" /></span></dd></dl>
<p>Clicking the drawing-pin reverts to default unpinned playback and recording, and the button will change back to the green triangle.
</p><p>Unpinned or pinned head can also be selected in <a href="tracks_preferences.html" title="Tracks Preferences">Tracks Preferences</a>.
</p>
<div class="note">For <a href="scrubbing_and_seeking.html" title="Scrubbing and Seeking">Scrubbing and Seeking</a>, Audacity will ignore the setting you make for fixed head playback unless you turn "<b>off</b>" the option for "<b>Always scrub unpinned</b>" in <a href="playback_preferences.html" title="Playback Preferences">Playback</a> preferences.</div>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_Timeline_Quick-Play">Using Timeline Quick-Play</span></h2>
<p>Timeline Quick-Play provides a quick and convenient means to either start playback from any point within the current project or to playback a region of audio. 
</p><p>As you hover the mouse pointer over the Timeline a small green triangle appears in the Timeline indicating that Quick-Play is enabled, and a white vertical line is drawn through the waveform(s) below to aid finding a precise Quick-Play location.  Note that if <a href="selection_toolbar.html#snap" title="Selection Toolbar">Snap-To</a> is enabled in the <a href="selection_toolbar.html" title="Selection Toolbar">Selection Toolbar</a> then the vertical line will be yellow and Quick-Play will honor the snapping.
</p><p>Timeline Quick-Play will work with the <a href="#pinned">pinned playhead</a> but clicking in the Timeline to indicate a new start point will cause that position to jump to the centered pinned head so you may find it better working with the unpinned playhead for Quick-Play.

<p>While Timeline Quick-Play is playing, the <a href="#quick-play-region">Quick-Play region</a> may be adjusted by clicking and dragging one or other end of the Quick-Play region. Playback then restarts from the original or new start of the Quick-Play region. If the <span class="kbrd" style="background-color: #e0e0f0">Shift</span> key is held down while adjusting the Quick-Play region, loop playback will restart from the original or new start of the Quick-Play region.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_selection">The selection</span></h3>
<p>By default, the audio selection or cursor position in the waveform is not affected by dragging the Quick-Play region. 
</p><p>This default behavior may be changed by choosing <b>Enable dragging selection</b> in the Timeline <a href="#menu">right-click menu</a>. When dragging the selection is enabled, the Quick-Play region will create or adjust the waveform selection. The selection persists after Quick-Play has stopped. To revert to the default behavior, select <b>Disable dragging selection</b> in the Timeline right-click menu.
</p><p>Note that dragging the selection cannot be enabled if the play region is locked (see below).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Locked_Play_Region">Locked Play Region</span></h3>
<p>Audacity allows the Play Region or Quick-Play Region to be <a href="#play-region">locked</a>. While a region is locked, Timeline Quick-Play will temporarily over-ride the lock, replacing the red locked Play Region with the standard gray Quick-Play region, so allowing Quick-Play to be used. Immediately the left mouse button is released, the red locked Play Region is restored. A locked play region cannot be adjusted.

<p><b>Disable/Enable Quick-Play</b>: Turns the Timeline Quick-Play functionality on or off <i>(some users may find the white cursor line on the waveform distracting when navigating over the Timeline)</i>.  The default setting is "on".
</p><p><b>Enable/Disable dragging selection</b>:  When disabled (default), left-click and dragging the Play Region adjusts the Play Region only, leaving the current selection or editing cursor unaffected.
When enabled, left-click and dragging the Play Region adjusts both the Play Region and the waveform selection together. This is particularly useful when finding the right place for a <a href="tutorial_looping.html" title="Tutorial - Looping">seamless loop</a>. 
</p><p><b>Disable/Enable Timeline Tooltips</b>: Timeline tooltips are visible when hovering over the Timeline. They are useful for indicating whether Timeline Quick-Play is enabled.  Experienced users may find that the Timeline tooltips get in the way, so this option allows these tooltips to be disabled. These tooltips are enabled by default.
</p><p><b>Do not scroll while playing</b>: By default the waveform scrolls when playing. Enabling this option not to scroll can be useful when using Quick-Play to adjust the start and end of <a href="tutorial_looping.html" title="Tutorial - Looping">loops</a>. Not scrolling ensures that the edges of the looped selection do not move if zooming in moves the playback point outside the visible area. The alternative method of disabling scrolling is to use <a href="tracks_preferences.html" title="Tracks Preferences">Tracks Preferences</a> and remove the checkmark from <i>Update display when Recording/Playback head is unpinned</i>.
</p><p><b>Lock Play Region</b>: The current position of the Play Region or Quick-Play region can be locked in the Timeline for use in all further standard playback, while still allowing Quick-Play of other regions or from other points.

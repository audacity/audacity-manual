<p>These commands provide an automatic way of aligning <a href="audacity_selection.html" title="Audacity Selection">selected tracks</a> with the cursor, the selection, or with the start of the project. 
</p><p>With the exception of the first two commands ("Align End to End" and "Align Together"), each selected track is moved along <i>equally</i> so they remain synchronized with each other. If a <a href="label_tracks.html" title="Label Tracks">label track</a> is included in the selection, its labels will also move equally so they remain synchronized.
</p><p>When aligning end to end or aligning together, the tracks are always moved individually to enforce the requested alignment (as described below). Label tracks are not affected by these two commands.
</p><p>When there is a selection, the commands that align tracks with the cursor/selection will align with the start of the selection, and when there is a cursor, the commands that align tracks with the cursor/selection will align with the cursor.

<td align="left" valign="top">If <a href="sync_locked_track_groups.html" title="Sync-Locked Track Groups">Sync-Lock Tracks</a> is enabled, unselected tracks in a Sync-Locked Track Group will also move so that all the tracks in that group remain synchronized, <b>except for</b> the Align "End to End" and "Together" commands where only the selected tracks will move. Aligning end to end or together overrides Sync-Lock Tracks if necessary, so the selected tracks in that group may become desynchronized.

<div class="note">
If a track contains multiple clips and one of the Align commands is applied to that track then <i>all the clips move and maintain their relative positions</i> to each other within the track. The start of the first clip is the "start of the track" and the end of the last clip is the "end of the track".</div>

<p>Aligns the selected tracks one after the other, based on their top-to-bottom order in the project window. The first selected track remains where it is, the start of the second selected track aligns with the end of the first selected track and so on. If you name a group of <a href="importing_audio.html" title="Importing Audio">imported</a> files from an album so that their alphabetical order is the same as the order you want to align them in, Align End to End will make the imported files play in their album order. 
</p><p>After the align, all tracks in the project (not just the selected tracks) will be fitted to the window so that the end of the last track will be visible in the project window.

<p>If you select multiple tracks, this command moves the tracks so that they all start at the same time, so audio within them changes its synchronization. The resultant start time is an average of all of the tracks' original starting times.

When it is <i>on</i>, the cursor or selection is moved to maintain its position relative to the tracks being moved. For example, <span class="menu">Tracks&#160;&gt;Align&#160;Tracks&#160;&gt;&#160;Start&#160;to&#160;Cursor/Selection&#160;Start</span> will align the selected tracks with the current cursor position or selection start, but then also move the cursor or selection along so that it remains at the same position relative to the new position of the aligned tracks.

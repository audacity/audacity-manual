<li> <b><a href="auto_duck.html" title="Auto Duck">Auto Duck</a>:</b> Reduces (ducks) the volume of one or more tracks whenever the volume of a specified "control" track reaches a particular level. Typically used to make a music track softer whenever speech in a commentary track is heard.</li>
<li> <b><a href="compressor.html" title="Compressor">Compressor</a>:</b> Compresses the <i><b><a href="glossary.html#dynamic_range" title="Glossary">dynamic range</a></b></i> by two alternative methods. The default "<i><b><a href="glossary.html#rms" title="Glossary">RMS</a></b></i>" method makes the louder parts softer, but leaves the quieter audio alone. The alternative "peaks" method makes the entire audio louder, but amplifies the louder parts less than the quieter parts. Make-up <i><b><a href="glossary.html#gain" title="Glossary">gain</a></b></i> can be applied to either method, making the result as loud as possible without <i><b><a href="glossary.html#clipping" title="Glossary">clipping</a></b></i>, but not changing the dynamic range further. </li>
<li> <b><a href="limiter.html" title="Limiter">Limiter</a>:</b> Limiter passes signals below a specified input level unaffected or gently reduced, while preventing the peaks of stronger signals from exceeding this threshold.

<li> <b><a href="fades.html#linearfade" title="Fades">Fade In</a>:</b> Applies a <i><b><a href="glossary.html#linear" title="Glossary">linear</a></b></i> fade-in to the selected audio - the rapidity of the fade-in depends entirely on the length of the selection it is applied to.

<li> <b><a href="sliding_stretch.html" title="Sliding Stretch">Sliding Stretch</a>:</b> This effect allows you to make a continuous change to the tempo and/or pitch of a selection by choosing initial and/or final change values.</li></ul>
<div id="filters"></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="EQ_and_Filters">EQ and Filters</span></h3>

<ul><li> <b><a href="click_removal.html" title="Click Removal">Click Removal</a>:</b> Click Removal is designed to remove clicks on audio tracks and is especially suited to declicking recordings made from vinyl records.</li>
<li> <b><a href="clip_fix.html" title="Clip Fix">Clip Fix</a>:</b> Clip Fix attempts to reconstruct clipped regions by interpolating the lost signal.</li>
<li> <b><a href="noise_gate.html" title="Noise Gate">Noise Gate</a>:</b> Reduces the level of sound below a specified threshold level. &gt;A noise gate is a kind of "dynamics processor" that allows audio above a specified threshold level to pass through unaffected (gate <i>"open"</i>), and stops or reduces sounds below the threshold level (gate <i>"closed"</i>).</li>
<li> <b><a href="noise_reduction.html" title="Noise Reduction">Noise Reduction</a></b>: This effect is ideal for reducing constant background noise such as fans, tape noise, or hums.

<li> <b><a href="reverb.html" title="Reverb">Reverb</a>:</b> A configurable stereo reverberation effect with built-in and user-added presets.

<ul><li> <b><a href="distortion.html" title="Distortion">Distortion</a>:</b> Use the Distortion effect to make the audio sound distorted. By distorting the waveform the frequency content is changed, which will often make the sound "crunchy" or "abrasive".  Technically this effect is a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveshaper">waveshaper</a>. The result of waveshaping is equivalent to applying non-linear amplification to the audio waveform. Preset shaping functions are provided, each of which produces a different type of distortion. </li>
<li> <b><a href="phaser.html" title="Phaser">Phaser</a>:</b> The name "Phaser" comes from "Phase Shifter", because it works by combining phase-shifted signals with the original signal.  The movement of the phase-shifted signals is controlled using a Low <i><b><a href="glossary.html#frequency" title="Glossary">Frequency</a></b></i> Oscillator (LFO).</li>
<li> <b><a href="tremolo.html" title="Tremolo">Tremolo</a>:</b> Modulates the volume of the selection at the depth and rate selected in the dialog. The same as the tremolo effect familiar to guitar and keyboard players.</li>
<li> <b><a href="vocoder.html" title="Vocoder">Vocoder</a>:</b> Synthesizes audio (usually a voice) in the left channel of a stereo track with a <i>carrier wave</i> (typically white noise) in the right channel to produce a modified version of the left channel. Vocoding a normal voice with white noise will produce a robot-like voice for special effects.</li>

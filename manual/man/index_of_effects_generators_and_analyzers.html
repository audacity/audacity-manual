		Low-Pass Filter</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="reverb.html" title="Reverb"><span title="Reverb adds reverberation (rapid, modified repetitions blended with the original sound that gives an impression of ambience). Adding reverberation is sometimes desirable for concert halls that are too small or contain so many people that the hall&#39;s natural reverberance is diminished.">Reverb</span></a></td>

		<td><a href="noise.html" title="Noise"><span title="Generates one of three different types of noise. White noise is that which has the greatest ability to mask other sounds, as it has similar energy at all frequency levels. Pink noise and Brownian noise both have more energy at lower frequencies, especially Brownian, which has the most muffled, low pitched sound of the three types.">Noise</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="reverse.html" title="Reverse"><span title="Reverses the selected audio, so that the end of the audio will be heard first and the beginning last. Some people reverse small portions of audio to make inappropriate language unintelligible, while others believe you can hear subliminal messages if you listen to speech backwards. You can also create interesting sound effects by recording natural events and reversing the audio.">Reverse</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="fades.html#studio_fadeout" title="Fades"><span title="Produces a smooth and &quot;musical&quot; sounding fade out from original volume to silence by applying a doubly-curved (S-shape) fade and fading out the higher frequencies a little quicker than the lower frequencies.

It behaves just like the bass, treble and volume controls on a domestic stereo system.">Bass and 			Treble</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="delay.html" title="Delay"><span title="Use Delay to create a multiple echo effect with options for variable delay times and the number, amplitude and pitch of repeats. Delay often adds audio, so clipping may result. Clipping can be removed using Amplify in 32-bit projects, otherwise undo Delay, de-amplify the audio, then apply Delay again.">Delay</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="noise_reduction.html" title="Noise Reduction"><span title="Noise Reduction can reduce constant background sounds such as hum, whistle, whine or buzz, and moderate amounts of hiss. It is not suitable for individual clicks and pops, or irregular background noise such as from traffic or an audience.">Noise 
		Reduction</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="rhythm_track.html" title="Rhythm Track"><span title="Rhythm Track generates a sequence of regular pulses at the selected tempo, beats per measure and either number of measures or track duration, using a selectable click sound. It can thus be used like a metronome for setting a steady beat against which an overdub recording can be made.">Rhythm Track</span></a></td>

	</tr>
	<tr style="background-color:#ddeeff" valign="top">
		<td><a href="beat_finder.html" title="Beat Finder"><span title="Beat Finder attempts to place labels at beats which are much louder than the surrounding audio. It&#39;s a fairly rough and ready tool, and will not necessarily work well on a typical modern pop music track with compressed dynamic range.">Beat Finder</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="distortion.html" title="Distortion"><span title="Use Distortion to make the audio sound more crunchy or abrasive. This is a &quot;waveshaper&quot; effect, equivalent to applying non-linear amplification to the audio waveform and so changing the frequency content.">Distortion</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="normalize.html" title="Normalize"><span title="Use Normalize to set the peak amplitude of a single track, make multiple tracks have the same peak amplitude and equalize the balance of left and right channels of stereo tracks. Optionally you can remove any DC offset from the tracks.">Normalize</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="risset_drum.html" title="Risset Drum"><span title="Risset Drum produces a sound based on work by the composer of electronic music, Jean Claude Risset. It consists of band-pass filtered noise, an enharmonic tone and a relatively strong sine wave at the fundamental.">Risset Drum</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="tremolo.html" title="Tremolo"><span title="Tremolo modulates the volume of the selection at the depth and speed selected in the dialog. This is the same as the tremolo effect familiar to guitar and keyboard players.">Tremolo</span></a></td>

Further information may be added as a header at the top of the file.">Sample Data Export</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="truncate_silence.html" title="Truncate Silence"><span title="Truncate Silence automatically reduces the length of passages where the volume is below the specified level for at least the specified duration. The effect offers a basic option that truncates to the exact length specified and an advanced option that reduces silences in proportion to their original duration.">Truncate 
		Silence</span></a></td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="background-color:#ddeeff" valign="top">
		<td><a href="change_speed.html" title="Change Speed"><span title="Use Change Speed to change the speed of a track, affecting its tempo, pitch and frequency content. When you slow a track down, all its frequencies become lower, and when you speed it up, they all become higher.">Change Speed</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="echo.html" title="Echo"><span title="Echo repeats the audio you have selected again and again, normally softer each time. Unlike Delay, Echo does not generate additional audio outside the selection, so it is often necessary to add sufficient silence to the end of your track(s) to accommodate your echo settings.">Echo</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="nyquist_prompt.html" title="Nyquist Prompt"><span title="Nyquist Prompt lets you run and debug code snippets for your own plug-ins created using the Nyquist programming language. This may be quicker than creating a complete plug-in which would require additional header lines.">Nyquist 
		Prompt</span></a></td>

		<td><a href="vocal_reduction_and_isolation.html" title="Vocal Reduction and Isolation"><span title="Vocal Reduction and Isolation... attempts to remove center-panned audio from a stereo track. Vocals are sometimes (but not always) recorded in this way. Most Remove options in this effect preserve the stereo image.">Vocal Reduction and Isolation</span></a></td>
	</tr>

		<td><a href="vocal_remover.html" title="Vocal Remover"><span title="This is now a legacy effect. The &quot;Vocal Reduction and Isolation&quot; effect has an action &quot;Remove Center Classic: (Mono)&quot; which is identical to removing the full frequency range with this effect. The other more advanced actions in &quot;Vocal Reduction and Isolation&quot; are slower than using this effect.">Vocal Remover <i>(legacy)</i></span></a></td>

	<tr style="background-color:#ddeeff" valign="top">
		<td><a href="chirp.html" title="Chirp"><span title="Chirp produces four different types of tones like the Tone Generator but additionally allows setting of the start and end amplitude and frequency. Short tones can be made to sound very much like a bird call.">Chirp</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="fades.html#linearfade" title="Fades"><span title="A fade in is often applied over a very short audio selection (less than a second). You may get a more &quot;musical&quot; result by applying a linear fade in three times to the same audio selection.">Fade In</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="phaser.html" title="Phaser"><span title="The name &quot;Phaser&quot; comes from &quot;Phase Shifter&quot;, because it works by combining phase-shifted signals with the original signal. The movement of the phase-shifted signals is controlled using a Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO). The effect&#39;s output may have higher amplitude than the original audio, leading to clipping. Clipping can be removed using Amplify in 32-bit projects, otherwise undo Phaser, de-amplify the audio, then apply Phaser again.">Phaser</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="silence.html" title="Silence"><span title="Generates audio of zero amplitude, the only configurable setting being duration. When applied to an audio selection, the result is identical to Edit &gt; Remove Special &gt; Silence Audio.">Silence</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="vocoder.html" title="Vocoder"><span title="Vocoder synthesizes a modulator (usually a voice) in the left channel of a stereo track with a carrier wave in the right channel to produce a modified version of the left channel. Vocoding a normal voice with white noise as provided in the effect will produce a robot-like voice for special effects.">Vocoder</span></a></td>

		Out</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="plot_spectrum.html" title="Plot Spectrum"><span title="Plot Spectrum takes the selected audio (which is a set of sound pressure values at points in time) and converts it to a graph of frequencies (Hz) against amplitudes (dB). You can choose different algorithms, log or linear axis and different size and type for the FFT window. You can also export the analysis to a text file.">Plot Spectrum</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="silence_finder.html" title="Silence Finder"><span title="Silence Finder divides up a track by placing point labels inside areas of silence. Use this if you just want to split the recording into tracks at a specific point without removing the silences between them.">Silence Finder</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="wahwah.html" title="Wahwah"><span title="Rapid tone quality variations, like that guitar sound so popular in the 1970&#39;s. The effect&#39;s output may have higher amplitude than the original audio, leading to clipping.

		<td><a href="click_removal.html" title="Click Removal"><span title="Click Removal attempts to remove clicks on audio tracks and is especially suited to declicking recordings made from vinyl records, without damaging the rest of the audio. Very soft and rapid light vinyl ticks that sound like crackle from static electricity will not be effectively removed. For this type of noise you should use Noise Removal instead.">Click Removal</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="find_clipping.html" title="Find Clipping"><span title="Displays runs of clipped samples in a Label Track, as a screen-reader accessible alternative to the View &gt; Show Clipping command. A run must include at least one clipped sample, but may include unclipped samples too.">Find Clipping</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="pluck.html" title="Pluck"><span title="Pluck generates a synthesized pluck tone with abrupt or gradual fade-out, and selectable pitch corresponding to a MIDI note. If you generate a short pluck and use Effect &gt; Repeat... on it, it can be used as an alternative to Rhythm Track.">Pluck</span></a></td>
		<td><a href="sliding_stretch.html" title="Sliding Stretch"><span title="Make a continuous change to the tempo and/or pitch of a selection by choosing initial and/or final change values. Tempo changes made without selecting a pitch change preserve the original pitch, and pitch changes made without selecting a tempo change preserve the original tempo.
